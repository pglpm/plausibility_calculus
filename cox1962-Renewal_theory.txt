Preface 
Renewal theory arose from the study of'self-renewing aggregates', 
but more recently has developed into the investigation of some 
general results in the theory of probability connected with sums of 
independent non-negative random variables. These results are  
applicable to quite a wide range of practical probability problems. The 
object of this monograph is to present the main results in an applied 
mathematical way. That is to say, the emphasis is on formulae that 
can be used to answer specific problems rather than on proofs of 
theorems under conditions of the utmost generality. 
The monograph is intended for students and research workers in 
statistics and probability theory, and for others, especially those in 
operational research, whose work involves the application of  
probability theory. To understand the monograph, familiarity with  
elementary probability theory is essential. It is also desirable to know 
about the simpler properties of the Laplace transform; the relevant 
results are, however, reviewed in one of the preliminary sections. 
Sections and equations are numbered according to the following 
system. Sections are numbered within chapters, equations within 
sections. Cross references are given with minimum duplication. 
For example, in section 5.5, a reference to equation (11) means 
equation (11) of that same section; equation (2.1) means equation 
(1) of section 5.2; equation (4.4.2) means equation (2) of section 
4.4. 
I am very grateful to Dr Walter L. Smith for arousing and  
maintaining my interest in renewal theory and to Mr H. D. Miller for very 
helpful comments on the manuscript.

CHAPTER 1 
Preliminaries 
1.1. Introduction 
Renewal theory began as the study of some particular probability 
problems connected with the failure and replacement of components, 
such as electric light bulbs. Later it became clear that essentially the 
same problems arise also in connexion with many other applications 
of probability theory and moreover that the fundamental  
mathematical theorems of renewal theory are of intrinsic interest in the 
theory of probability. Hence much recent work in the subject is not 
specifically connected with the replacement of components. At the 
same time, however, with the current surge of interest in the  
mathematical problems of operational research, new problems connected 
with the replacement of components have been formulated, not all 
within the framework of renewal theory in the original sense. 
The plan of this monograph is as follows. In Chapters 2-5 we deal 
with the principal general formulae of renewal theory. These will be 
treated from an applied mathematical point of view; that is, we do 
not give rigorous proofs of the results under the most general  
conditions possible. In Chapters 6-9 some extensions of the fundamental 
models of renewal theory are given. Chapters 1-9 form a  
self-contained course in renewal theory for those whose interest is in applied 
probability theory, not necessarily in connexion with operational 
research. 
Chapters 10 and 11 are more specialized. Chapter 10 deals with 
models of failure. Chapter 11 discusses a number of problems  
connected with the replacement of components, in particular with the 
study of replacement strategies. Problems of statistical analysis  
connected with renewal theory are not considered in this monograph. 
1.2. The distribution of failure-time 
Suppose that we have a population of components, each component 
characterized by a non-negative random variable, Xy called its 
1 
2 Renewal theory 
failure-time. It is best to think of the components as physical objects, 
such as electric light bulbs, valves, etc., the failure-time being the age 
of the component at which some clearly defined event caWcd failure 
occurs. However, we shall see later that the terms component 
and failure-time can be given many different concrete  
interpretations. 
The random variable, X, is non-negative and there are in practice 
two main cases to consider: 
(a) there is positive constant, h, such that the only possible values 
of^are{0,/i,2A,...}; 
(b) the random variable has an (absolutely) continuous  
distribution over the range (0, oo), its distribution being determined by a 
probability density function (p.d.f.). 
The main problems of renewal theory for (a), renewal theory in 
discrete time, have been very carefully discussed by Feller (1957, 
Chapter 13). In the present book we shall, therefore, concentrate on 
(b), renewal theory in continuous time. There are, of course,  
possibilities intermediate between (a) and (b). The main such case of 
practical interest seems to be that in which there is a discrete  
probability at zero failure-time, the remaining probability being  
continuously distributed. Results for this situation are usually easily 
derived from the results for a general continuous distribution. 
We suppose, then, except when explicitly stated otherwise, 
that the random variable X has a p.d.f. /(x), zero for negative x, 
that is 
prob(^ < ^^ a:+Jx) 
f(x) = lim » (1) 
with 
jf(x)dx = 1. (2) 
Moreover the failure-times Xi, X2, ... of different components will 
be assumed mutually independent. 
The distribution of A"is determined by the p.d.f.,/(jc), but it is for 
some purposes convenient to work with other functions equivalent 
Preliminaries 3 
to/(x). One such is the cumulative distribution function, F(x), giving 
the probability that a component has failed by time x. That is 
Fix) = prob(^< x) 
X 
= JAu)du. (3) 
0 I 
Clearly F(x) is a non-decreasing function of x with F(0) = 0, 
F(oo) = 1. Equation (3) gives F{x) in terms of the p.d.f.,/(x).  
Conversely, on differentiating (3), 
Ax) = F\x), (4) 
determining/(x) for a given F{x). 
For some purposes it is slightly more convenient to work with the 
function complementary to F{x). This is the survivor function, ^(x), 
^(x) = prob(A^> x) 
= \-F{x) 
00 
= \fiM)du, (5) 
X 
giving the probability that a component has not failed up to time x. 
Clearly ^(0) = 1, ^{co) = 0 and ^{x) is a non-increasing function 
of X. Also 
fix) = -^\xy (6) 
Figure 1.1 shows the functions/(x), F{x) and ^{x) for a typical 
distribution. Both functions F{x) and ^(x) often arise very naturally, 
for example in considering the probability that a component will 
survive a guarantee period, xq. 
Another function equivalent to/U) is the age-specific failure rate, 
0(x), defined as follows. Consider a component known not to have 
failed at time x and let fj>(x) be the limit of the ratio to Jx of the 
4 Renewal theory 
probability of failure in (x, x+ Ax), That is, in the usual notation for 
conditional probability, 
0(x) = lim 
prob(x < ^^ x+Ax\x < X)

Thus, roughly speaking, ^(x) gives the probability of almost  
immediate failure of a component known tb^e of age x. This function 
is widely used in actuarial work. Now for any two events A and B, 
prob(^|5) = 
prob (A and B)

But the event 'x < X^x+Ax and jc < ^' is the same as the event 
'x< ^=^jc+Jx'. Thus

Preliminaries 
Because of (6), we can write (8) in the form 
0W = 
^W 
= --{logi^W}. (9) 
Hence, on using the condition ^(0) = 1 and integrating (9), we have 
that 
^(x) = exp - J ^(m) du , (10) 
from which f(x) = ^(x)exp I - j ^(m)du\, (11) 
showing that (f)(x) uniquely determines the p.d.f.,/(x). 
We shall consider in section 4 special types of distribution  
important in renewal theory, but one immediate simple and important 
illustration of the above formulae is provided by the exponential 
distribution of parameter p, that is 
Ax) = pe-P\ (12) 
Note that in (12),/(x) is, as always, taken to be zero for negative x. 
For the p.d.f. (12), 
^(x) = J 
pe-P"du 
-px 
so that, by (8), 
^(x) = p. (13) 
Conversely it is easily shown from (11) that if (f>(x) is constant, the 
distribution must be exponential. Thus the exponential distribution 
is characterized by a probability of immediate failure of a  
component not depending on the age of the component. This  
independence of age makes the mathematical problems of renewal theory 
6 Renewal theory 
virtually trivial when the distribution is exponential, as we shall see 
repeatedly in the rest of the monograph. 
Figure 1.2 shows some typical forms for ^(jc) for non-exponential 
distributions. If ^(jc) is an increasing function of jc (Fig. 1.2a), we may 
say that there is positive ageing; the older the component, the more 
likely is immediate failure. If ^(a:) is a decreasing function of x 
(Fig. 1.2b), we say that there is negative ageing; the older the  
component, the less likely is immediate failure. One possible explanation 
Fig. 1.2. Some typical age-specific failure rates, «^(a:). 
(a) Positive ageing. 
(b) Negative ageing. 
(c) Initial period of negative ageing, followed by 
positive ageing. 
of this would be that some components are initially defective and 
particularly liable to early failure. In general, the function ^(jc) need 
be neither strictly increasing nor strictly decreasing, although many 
of the special distributions to be considered in section 4 do have 
monotonic ^(jc). In some contexts we may expect to find ^(jc) having 
the general form shown in Fig. 1,2c. That is, <f)(x) first decreases quite 
sharply and is then practically constant for some time, before 
eventually increasing. 
It must be stressed that the functions/(A:), F(x), ^(x) and ^(x) are 
mathematically completely equivalent. Most of the mathematical 
results will be expressed in terms of one of the first three functions, 
Preliminaries 1 
but insight is very often gained by thinking about 0(x), especially in 
studying strategies of replacement. When working graphically or 
numerically with estimates of <i>{x) from data, it is often useful to plot 
^(x) at the same time, because it is not immediately apparent from 
<j){x) what is the range of failure-times in which the majority of 
failures occur. 
Finally, we shall define in the usual way the mean, variance, 
moments and semi-invariants of failure-time, and so far as possible 
use the conventional notation. For example, with E denoting  
mathematical expectation, 
00 
^ = E{X) = J xf{x)dx, (14) 
0 
a^ = E{X-ixf, (15) 
lir = E{X') (r= 1,2,...), (16) 
lir^E{X-iiy (r = 2,3,...) (17) 
are, respectively, the mean, variance, moments about the origin and 
moments about the mean. The moments {^i'^] can be expressed in 
terms of {/x^} and vice versa and in particular 
^2 = CT^ = M2-M^- (18) 
Occasionally we use instead of the moments, the semi-invariants 
(Cramer, 1946, p. 185). The dispersion of a distribution is often  
conveniently measured dimensionlessly by the coefficient of variation, 
defined as ojii. 
1.3. Laplace transforms 
(i) Definition and main properties 
One of the main mathematical tools used in renewal theory is the 
Laplace transform. Detailed accounts of this are given, for example, 
by Widder (1946) and, from a more applied point of view, by yan der 
Pol and Bremmer (1955). Here a brief outline only is given of the 
main results. 
8 Renewal theory 
Suppose first that f(x) is the p.d.f. of a non-negative random 
variable, X. The Laplace transform,/*(5), is defined by 
/*(5) = £(^-^^) 
V(x)dx. (1) 
-!■ 
It is convenient sometimes to use the alternative notation -S?{/(x); 5}, 
that is 
^{Ax);s}^f*(s). (2) 
Note that, in this new notation, the Laplace transform is a function 
of s and not of the argument x occurring to the left of the semicolon. 
We sometimes use t instead of x for the argument of the function 
whose Laplace transform is taken. 
Now, since/(x) is a p.d.f., it follows from (1) that 
/♦(O) = 1 ■ 
and moreover that 0 <f*{s) ^ 1 for all s^O. Sometimes it is useful 
to consider/♦C^) as a function of the complex variable 5, and then it 
can be shown to be analytic in a half-plane. Re (5) > sq, where sq ^ 0. 
This is enough to justify many of the formal manipulations that we 
shall make. 
As an example, consider the exponential distribution (2.12). The 
corresponding Laplace transform is 
00 
\ pe-P''e-'''dx = -^' (3) 
Note that it is often useful in recalling formulae to regard A'as having 
the dimensions of [time], f(x) and s as having the dimensions of 
[time]~S the Laplace transform itself being dimensionless. 
Another example, which will turn out to be important later, is 
(p(px)'^~^e~P'' \ p^" 
Preliminaries 
In (4), the gamma function, Aa), is defined by 
r(a) = J u""- 
^e-"du. 
If a is a positive integer, this is (a-1)! 
Except for the sign of s, the Laplace transform is the moment 
generating function used in mathematical statistics. Proceeding 
formally, we have that, provided that sq < 0, 
(CO „r Yr\ 
the rth moment of X about the origin, as it exists, is given by the  
coefficient of (—sY/rl in the Taylor expansion of/*(5) (Cramer, 1946, 
p. 177). To obtain the moments, /x^, about the mean, e^^f*{s) should 
be expanded. As an example, take again the exponential distribution, 
with Laplace transform p/(p + s). The Taylor expansion is 
i (-ir^v/, 
r = 0 
whence yiy = r\lp\ In particular the mean, /x, is 1/p and the variance, 
a^, is 
2 / 2 
= 1/p'. (6) 
Thus for the exponential distribution a = /x. 
So far we have considered the Laplace transform only for functions 
that are p.d.f.'s. However, the definition (1) extends immediately to 
arbitrary functions defined over (0, co), provided that the integral 
converges. Thus for a given function k{x), we define k*{s) and 
^{k{xy,s}hy 
00 
k*{s) = ^{k{xy,s} = J e-'''k{x)dx, (7) 
10 Renewal theory 
This transform is widely used in applied mathematics, particularly in 
the solution of differential and integral equations. The function k*(s), 
as a function of the complex variable s, is analytic in a half-plane 
Re (5) > 5o, although no general statement can be made about the 
value of sq. 
The following further results are important and quite easily proved. 
It is supposed that s is such that all integrals are convergent. Then 
^{x'^is} = r(m+l)/5'" + ^ (m > -1), (8) 
nkXx);s} = sk*(s)-k(0), (9) 
^{k^'\x);s} = s'k*{s)-s''-^k(0)-s'-^kXO)-...-k^'-^\0), (10) 
^ JA:(m)^m;5 = k*{s)ls (Re(5) > 0), (11) 
^U k{u)du;s\ = {k*(0)-k*{s)}ls (Re(5) > 0). (12) 
When the general function k{x) is replaced by a p.d.f. f{x), 
equations (11) and (12) become 
F*{s) = f*{s)ls, (13) 
^*{s) = {\-r{s)}/s, (14) 
two important results. 
Equations (9)-(12) are proved by integration by parts. 
(ii) Sums of independent random variables 
The main importance of Laplace transforms in renewal theory is in 
connexion with sums of independent random variables. Let Xi,...,X„ 
be non-negative random variables independently distributed with 
p.d.f.'s/i(x),. . . ,fn{x). The Laplace transform of the p.d.f. of 
Xi-]-.,.-\-Xn is, by definition, 
£[exp{-5(A^i + ... + A^„)}] = £(^-^^\..e-^^«) 
= E{e-'^^)...E{e-'^-) 
= /f(^).../J(^), (15) 
Preliminaries 11 
the second line following because the expectation of the product of 
mutually independent random variables is the product of their 
separate expectations. 
The corresponding explicit formula for the p.d.f. of A^i +... + A'^ is 
quite complicated, being

convolution of/i(x),... ,/„(x), will not be used explicitly.in^this^hook,

An important special case arises when the X^. are identically  
distributed, so that we Qan write/^Oc) =f(x), say. Then the p.d,f, of 
A^i +... +^«> to be denoted by/(„)(x) and called the «-fold  
convolution of/(x), is such that 
This is a most important result, which we shall use repeatedly. 
As an example, suppose again that/(x) = pe~^^(x > 0), so that 
f*{s) = pl(p + s). Then the Laplace transform of/(„)(x) is p^l{p-\-sy. 
Now, by (4), this is the Laplace transform of the function 
That is, the functions/(„)(;c) and (18) have identical Laplace  
transforms. We shall see in the next subsection that this implies that the 
two p.d.f.'s are the same. 
(iii) The inversion problem 
Suppose that we have calculated the Laplace transform /:*(5) of an 
as yet unknown function k{x). The problem of finding k{x) from k*{s) 
is called the inversion problem. A crucial result is that for all types of 
function that we shall consider in this book, and in particular'for all 
continuous functions, the function k{x) is uniquely determined by 
12 Renewal theory 
k^{s), with the understanding that two functions that differ only a set 
/of X-values of measure zero are counted as equivalent. 
It follows that if, as at the end of (ii), we can recognize a function 
k{x) for which k*{s) is the Laplace transform, our problem is solved. 
Extensive tables (Bateman Manuscript Project, 1954) are available 
giving the Laplace transforms of common functions and giving k{x) 
corresponding to common forms of k*{s). 
Explicit formulae for k{x) in terms of k*{s) are sometimes useful 
and the most common such inversion formula is (Widder, 1946, p. 66; 
van der Pol and Bremmer, 1955, Chapter 2) 
C+ICX> 
k{x) = ~ 1 e'''k*{s)ds, (19) 
where the path of integration is parallel to the imaginary axis, c being 
chosen so that all singularities of k*{s) lie to the left of the line of 
integration. 
The use in renewal theory of the inversion formula (19) will be 
illustrated in section 4.3. Here we give just one simple example. 
Suppose that k*{s) = p/(p + 5). Then 
C + /cx> 
Kx) = --, ^ds, (20) 
c—ioo 
where c> — p. In particular the line of integration can be taken to be 
the imaginary axis. Now convert the line into a closed contour by 
taking the limit of the line from c — iRtoc-\- iR completed by a  
semicircle of radius R to the left of the imaginary axis (Fig. 1.3). It is easily 
shown by the usual arguments that if x > 0 the integral round the 
semicircle tends to zero as i? -^ oo and hence, by the theorem of 
residues. 
k{x) = y JResidues of ^^^^}. (21)

13 
where the sum is over the poles of the integrand inside the contour. 
But there is only one such pole, at 5 = — p, and the residue there is 
k{x) = pe-P"" {x > 0). 
It can be shown similarly that k{x), defined by (20), is zero for x <0. 
Fig. 1.3. Contour of integration in complex 5-plane. 
(iv) Asymptotic expansions 
We shall commonly find that, although we can find a quite simple 
expression for the Laplace transform, k*{s), of the function k{x) in 
which we are interested, the inversion cannot be done explicitly in 
simple terms. It is then natural to look for asymptotic relations valid 
usually as X -^ 00, or occasionally as x -^0. 
One method that can sometimes be used is to work with the 
complex inversion formula (19), applying some general asymptotic 
technique to it, such as the saddle point method (de Bruijn, 1958, 
Chapters 5, 6). More usually, however, we shall exploit the general 
principle that in the equation 
'c*(s) = j 
e-"k(x)dx. 
(22) 
14 Renewal theory 
(a) the behaviour of k{x) for x near 0 is associated with the 
behaviour of k*{s) as s tends to oo; 
(b) the behaviour of k{x) as x tends to infinity is associated with 
the behaviour of k*{s) for s near zero. 
These results should be qualitatively clear from the definition of 
k*(js). Thus if s is very large, e""^^ is negligible except when x is very 
small, so that k*{s) will depend on the behaviour of k{x) near zero. 
The main result of this type used in renewal theory is that if as 
5-^0, for constants A and B, 
k*{s) = -^ + --^0{l), (23) 
then as X -^ 00, kix) = Ax-}-B-\-o{\). (24) 
In (23), 0(1) denotes a function of s bounded as 5->0, whereas o{l) 
in (24) denotes a function of x tending to zero as x-^ oo. A result of 
this type, enabling the limiting behaviour of k{x) to be deduced 
from that of k*{s), is called a Tauberian theorem. 
In a formal way the passage from (23) to (24) is easy, because 1/5^ 
and l/s are respectively the Laplace transforms of x and 1. However, 
the theorem is only true under restrictions on k{x) sufficient to exclude 
rapid oscillations in k{x) as x->oo. Except in very simple cases, 
Tauberian theorems are therefore difficult to handle. For this reason, 
rigorous proof of the general theorems of renewal theory under the 
most general conditions requires delicate mathematical arguments 
which we shall not go into in this monograph. 
There is, however, one situation in which the rigorous proof of (24) 
is easy. Suppose that 
k*{s) = 4 + - + /c*(5), (25) 
where k*{s) is a rational function of the complex variable s bounded 
at 00 and with all its poles having negative real parts. 
It is now quite easy to prove (24) by splitting k*{s) into partial 
fractions or by applying the complex inversion formula of the pre- 
Preliminaries 15 
vious subsection. The method will be discussed in more detail when 
it is used on a specific problem in section 4.3. 
1.4. Special distributions 
(i) Generalities. Many of the general results in renewal theory can 
be used for arbitrary p.d.f.'s,/(x). Nevertheless it is very useful to 
have in mind a number of special mathematical forms that can be 
used to represent the distribution of failure-time. The special  
distributions (ii)-(iv) below are of importance because they much simplify 
the general formulae of renewal theory. The remaining distributions 
(v)-(vii) are included because they are often useful in other problems 
about failure-times, such as the study of replacement strategies. 
The symbols p, a and a will be used for parameters of distributions. 
The interpretation will depend on the particular distribution under 
consideration, but all are always positive, p always has the dimensions 
[time]~^, a is dimensionless and a is used instead of a when only 
integral values are allowable. All p.d.f.'s are taken to be zero for 
negative x. 
The circumstances under which the various special distributions 
may be expected in practice are discussed in Chapter 10. The present 
section is confined to a descriptive account of the properties of the 
distributions. 
(ii) Exponential distribution. This has already been used as an 
example several times in the preceding two sections. The p.d.f. is 
pe~P^, the survivor function e~P^, the age-specific failure rate is 
constant and equal to p, and the Laplace transform is pl{s-\-p). 
Further, the mean and standard deviation are both equal to 1/p, so 
that the coefficient of variation is one. We shall call pe~P^ the  
exponential distribution with rate parameter p. 
(iii) Special Erlangian distribution. The p.d.f. is 
where a is a positive integer. By (3.4) the Laplace transform is 
\p + s) ' 
(2) 
16 Renewal theory 
The importance of these distributions arises from two closely  
associated facts. The first is the simplicity of the Laplace transform (2). 
The second is the following connexion of the distribution (1) with 
the exponential distribution, which is, of course, the special case 
a=l. 
Let failure take place in a stages, the times Ti,..., Y^ spent in these 
stages being independently exponentially distributed with the p.d.f. 
pe'P^. We suppose that at the end of the first stage, after time Yi, 
the second stage is started, and so on, failure occurring at the end of 
the ath stage. Thus the failure-time, A", is I^i +... + y^. As proved in 
(3.18), the distribution of A'is then the special Erlangian distribution 
(1). There is no need for the stages to have physical significance; 
whenever the p.d.f. of failure-time is (1) we can always make  
mathematical calculations as if failure occurred in the a stage process just 
described. This idea was introduced into the theory of congestion in 
telephone systems by A. K. Erlang and has been widely used since to 
simplify probability calculations in the theory of queues (Cox and 
Smith, 1961, section 5.2). It is important in renewal theory for 
essentially the same reason. We shall call (1) the special Erlangian 
distribution with a stages. 
There are two important generalizations of (1) and we defer the 
discussion of descriptive properties until we deal in (v) with the second 
of these generalizations, the F distribution. 
(iv) General Erlangian distribution. A mathematical characteristic 
of (iii) is the simplicity of the Laplace transform. A physical  
characteristic is the interpretation in terms of stage-by-stage failure. Both 
these properties are retained in the family of general Erlangian  
distributions, which is defined as that of distributions of continuous 
non-negative random variables for which the Laplace transform 
of the p.d.f. is a rational function of s, that is, is the ratio of two 
polynomials. 
It can be shown that any distribution of failure-time can be 
approximated arbitrarily closely by a general Erlangian distribution. 
The most useful of the more general distributions are, however, those 
that give coefficients of variation that cannot be reasonably  
approximated by a special Erlangian distribution. Two particular cases will 
be mentioned briefly here. 
Preliminaries 17 
First there is a simple generalization of the special Erlangian  
distribution in which the exponential distributions in the a stages have 
parameters pu ».., Pa- The Laplace transform is then 
(Pl + S),,.(pa+S) 
The p.d.f. is best obtained by expressing (3) in partial fraction form as 
^iPi ^ 
'Pi+s 
2; 
Where ^^ = V\7-^T 
The p.d.f. is therefore 2 ^/P/^~^'"", (4) 
with the usual modifications if two or more pi are equal. For a fixed 
value of a, it is easily shown that any mean and any fractional  
coefficients of variation between 1 and 1 / V« can be produced by suitable 
choice of {p/}. The main practical interest is likely to be in small values 
of a, especially a = 2, 3,4. Using these values we can obtain a  
mathematically very simple form for a distribution having any desired mean 
and any coefficient of variation between 1 and J. 
For the second type of generalization, suppose that with probability 
6 the failure mechanism enters the first stage, with p.d.f. of failure- 
time, pie~P^^, and that with probability 1 - ^ the mechanism enters 
the second stage with p.d.f., P2^~^^^' Let failure occur at the end of 
the single stage, whichever it may be. Then the p.d.f. is 
dp^e-P'''-{-{\-d)p2e-P''' 
and the Laplace transform \y^ 
^P\ ^(^-B)P2 ^PlP2+0plS+(l-d)p2S ^^^ 
Pl-^S p2-^S (Pl-^s)ip2 + s) 
It can be shown that by suitable choice of ^, pi, P2 we can produce 
distributions having any desired mean and any fractional coefficient 
of variation between 1 and oo. 
18 Renewal theory 
With a little ingenuity many kinds of behaviour of distributions can 
be simulated using quite simple members of the general Erlangian 
Jfemily and, for such distributions, we shall see that formal solution 
of the problems of renewal theory is usually in principle quite simple. 
The reason is that the Laplace transforms of the functions in which we 
are interested in renewal theory are rational functions o{f*{s) and 
hence, for the present distributions, are rational functions of s. The 
inversion problem for rational functions is, in principle, easy, even if 
the details are cumbersome in particular cases. 
(v) Gamma distribution. A second generalization of (iii) is to 
replace the parameter a restricted to the values 1,2,... by a parameter 
a taking any real positive value. We then obtain the p.d.f. of a P 
distribution, namely 
pipxr-'e-P"" 
r(a) 
(6) 
The main properties of the F distribution are as follows: 
(a) The mean and standard deviation are respectively a//o and 
A/(a)//), so that the fractional coefficient of variation is 1/Va. Hence 
there is just one F distribution with preassigned mean and standard 
deviation. But if we restrict ourselves to integral a, we can only obtain 
fractional coefficients of variation 1, 1/a/2, 1/a/3, J,.... 
(b) When a = 1, the distribution is exponential. When 0 < a < I, 
the p.d.f. has infinite ordinate at the origin. When a > 1, the p.d.f. is 
zero at the origin and has a single maximum at x = (a—1)1 p. If we 
take the limit of (6) as a, /> -^ oo with the mean cc/p fixed, and equal 
say to ju, the distribution is asymptotically normal around /x with 
fractional coefficient of variation l/Va. The ultimate limiting form 
is thus a degenerate distribution with all the probability concentrated 
at X = ju. Four special cases are shown in Fig. 1.4, all but the first 
being special Erlangian distributions.

20 Renewal theory 
For special Erlangian distributions, when a is an integer a, it can 
be shown by integrating by parts that 
F(x) = l-2 ~^' (10) 
Another way of expressing (10) is to introduce a discrete random 
variable Z having a Poisson distribution of mean px. Then (10) is 
equivalent to the equation 
prob(A' ^ jc) = prob(Z > a). (11) 
A probabilistic proof of (11) using the stage interpretation of the 
special Erlangian distribution will be given in section 3.1. 
(d) When p = i and a = J6, where b is an integer, the distribution 
(6) is known in mathematical statistics as the x^ distribution with b 
degrees of freedom. 
(e) The age-specific failure rate, ^(jc), can be calculated from (6) 
and (10). If 0 < a < 1, there is negative ageing, with 
<l>{x) -^ 00 as X -> 0, <l>(x) -^ p as X -> 00, 
whereas if a > 1, there is positive ageing with 
0(0) = 0, (f)(x) -> p as X -> 00. 
Many empirical distributions can be represented, at least roughly, 
by suitable choice of the parameters a and p, and this, combined with 
the relative simplicity of the distribution, makes it a most useful one. 
For many of the problems of renewal theory there is a very substantial 
further advantage in using a special Erlangian distribution, i.e. in 
taking a integral. To obtain numerical answers for non-integral a it 
may sometimes be preferable to interpolate numerically between 
solutions for integral a, rather than to proceed directly with the theory 
for the value of a concerned. 
(vi) Extreme-value distribution. Another two-parameter family of 
distributions containing the exponential distribution as a special case 
Preliminaries 21 
is the so-called extreme-value distribution, or Weibull distribution, 
defined by the survivor function equal, for x > 0, to 
Qxpi-ipxri (12) 
and therefore by the p.d.f. 
oip(pxr-'Qxp{-(px)% (13) 
The connexion with the theory of extreme values will be discussed in 
section 10.2; strictly (12) is only one of three possible types of extreme- 
value distribution, but it is the one usually most relevant to failure- 
times. 
The age-specific failure rate, being the ratio of (13) to (12), is 
<t>{x) = oip(pxr-\ (14) 
If a > 1, there is positive ageing with 0(^) varying from zero to 
infinity as x increases. If a < 1, there is negative ageing. 
It follows from (12) that 
prob(A^^ > x) = prob(A^ > x^^^) 
= exp(-p^x), 
showing that X'^ has an exponential distribution with parameter p'^. 
In other words, the distribution specified by (12) can be obtained from 
an exponential distribution by a very simple power law  
transformation of the time scale. 
The rth moment of the distribution is 
ap'^ J x''~^'^~^Qxp{-(px)°'}dx 
0 
and, if we put (px)'^ = m, this becomes 
00 
lj„^'«.-v« = lr(^+i). (15)

Thus the mean is (16)

Gumbel (1958, p. 282) has tabulated the standard measure of skew- 
ness, y 1, for the WeibuU distribution and a brief extract from his table 
is included in Table 1.1. The value ofyi-^~M4asa-^oo and the 
coefficient of variation tends to zero. The skewness is, however, 
positive provided that a < 3-6 and tends to infinity as a-^0.

which, on writing {log(p?;)}/\/a = u, becomes

where G{t) = ——- e'"'^du (20) 
V(2n 
is the standardized normal probability integral. The result (19) shows 
that the random variable log X is normally distributed with mean 
— logp and variance a, and hence the name log-normal distribution 
given to (18). 
The mean of the distribution is p'^e'^^^ and the coefficient of 
variation is a/(^^— !)• For small values of a, the distribution is nearly 
normal. For large values of a, the distribution has large positive 
skewness. The properties of the log-normal distribution are discussed 
in detail by Aitchison and Brown (1957). 
One important special property of the distribution concerns the age- 
specific failure rate, which from (18) and (19) is equal to 
1 r {iog(p^)}'i 1 ,.,, 
;cV(27ra)'^l 2a J^^ Mxp)V ^^^^ 
It can be shown that (21) increases to a maximum and then  
decreases to zero as x-^ 00 (Watson and Wells, 1961). The log-normal 
distribution is sometimes useful in empirical problems connected 
with renewals because {a) statistical problems connected with the log- 
normal distribution are often easily solved by a log transformation, 
and {b) it is sometimes desired to represent fairly simply an age- 
specific failure rate having a maximum. 
Finally, it is useful to compare briefly the three two-parameter 
families of distributions, the F distribution, the WeibuU distribution 
and the log-normal distribution. In all three families the parameters 
can be adjusted to give assigned values to the mean and coefficient of 
variation. The comparison can be made first in terms of the different 
24 Renewal theory 
behaviours of the age-specific failure rates already noted. Secondly, 
the density functions as x -^ oo are respectively of order  
approximately e-P"", exp{- (px)*} and ^-^^^^^^/^^a)^ j^^^ -^ -^ plausible that 
for a given mean and coefficient of variation the log-normal  
distribution has the longest' tail'. The WeibuU distribution comes next if and 
only if the coefficient of variation exceeds one, i.e. if and only if a in 
the WeibuU distribution is less than one. 
A similar conclusion is obtained from the relation between the 
coefficient of skewness y i and the coefficient of variation. For the F 
distribution 
yi = 2 X coefF. of variation, 
for the log-normal distribution 
yi = 3 X coefF. of variation + (coefF. of variation)^, 
the value for the WeibuU distribution being given in Table 1.1. 
CHAPTER 2 
The Fundamental Models 
2.1. The ordinary renewal process 
Suppose that we have a population of components and that failure- 
time, X, is a continuous random variable with p.d.f./(jc). It is again 
to be stressed that the terms component and failure-time can be given 
many different interpretations. Suppose further that we start with a 
new component at time zero. This component fails at time Xj, say. 
Let it be replaced immediately by a new component with failure-time, 
X2, say. Then the second failure will occur after a total time Xx + X2. 
Let this process be continued, a component being replaced  
immediately on failure by a new component. The failure-time of the rth  
component used is Xr and the rth failure occurs at time 5^., where 
5, = Xi + ... + A^,. (1) 
If {Xx, ^2,...} are independent identically distributed random  
variables, all with p.d.f. fix), we call the system an {ordinary) renewal 
process. 
If, in particular, the distribution is exponential (section 1.4 (ii)) 
with p.d.f. pe~P^, we call the ordinary renewal process a Poisson 
process of rate p. The main properties are derived from first principles 
in section 3. 
We now define, for the ordinary renewal process, a number of 
associated random variables whose study is the object of the first 
part of this book. 
(i) Time up to the rth renewal. For some fixed value of r, we may 
wish to know the time at which the rth renewal will occur. This is 
precisely the random variable, 5^., defined in (1). 
(ii) Number of renewals in time t. Fix a time t and define the random 
variable, iV„ as the number of renewals occurring in (0, r).t Note that 
t It is, with continuous failure-times, equivalent to use the open interval 
(0, t). In future, we shall not usually bother to distinguish between the open 
and closed intervals, although in discrete problems the distinction is 
important. 
25 
26 Renewal theory 
the new component at ^ = 0 is not counted as a renewal. The random 
variable, A^^, is often the thing about the process of most interest. 
More generally, we may take two fixed time points ^i, ?2 (^i < ^2) and 
define 
Nt.,t. = ^u-^t. (2) 
to be the number of renewals in (^j, ^2)- We shall see that, formally, 
the properties of A^,^, t^ can be obtained in much the same way as 
those of A^,. 
(iii) The renewal function. We are sometimes particularly concerned 
with the mean value of N^. The function 
Hit) = E{N,) (3) 
is called the renewal function. Note that, for the more general random 
variable A^,^, ^^, we have from (2) that 
E{N,^^,) = H(t2)-H{t,X (4) 
(iv) Renewal density. Consider for any time t, the function h{t) 
defined by 
h{t) = lim -—— 
Jr->0+ ^t 
= HV). (5) 
This is called the renewal density and specifies the mean number of 
renewals to be expected in a narrow interval near t. Since the random 
variables {Xf] are continuous, with no concentration of probability 
at zero failure-time, the probability of more than one failure in an 
interval of length At is 0(At)^. It follows that 
ij(f\ _ r P^ot) {one, or more, renewals in (t, t+ At)} 
An alternative, deterministic, interpretation of h(t) is that if we have 
a very large number m of independent renewal processes in operation 
simultaneously, mh{t)At is the number of renewals in the time 
interval (^^+JO. 
The fundamental models 
11 
(v) Higher moments ofN^. For some purposes we require also the 
higher moments of A^„ especially the variance. 
(vi) Backward recurrence-time. Let ^ be a fixed time point. Define 
the random variable Uf as the length of time measured backwards 
from t to the last renewal at or before t. If there have been no renewals 
up to t, Uf is defined to be t. Thus Ut is the age of the component in 
use at t (see Fig. 2Aa).

(b) 
Fig. 2.1. Definition of recurrence-times Ut, Vf 
(a) Backward recurrence-time, Uf; 
(b) Forward recurrence-time, Vf. 
(vii) Forward recurrence-time. Similarly, let Vj be the time 
measured from t to the next renewal to occur after t (see Fig. 2.1b). 
This random variable is called the forward recurrence-time. Another 
name is residual life-time; for Vt is the remaining life of the  
component in use at time t. 
2.2. Two other models 
The ordinary renewal process can be generalized in many ways, some 
of which will be considered in Chapters 6-9. There are, however, two 
new processes differing only slightly from the ordinary renewal 
process, and it is convenient to deal with these immediately. 
First suppose that, as before, failures occur at times 
Xu ^1 + ^2, ^1 + ^2+^3,..., 
where {A^i, A^2» - • •} are independent non-negative continuous random 
variables. Let Xi have p.d.f./i(x) and let A^2» -^3» • • • all have the same 
p.d.f./(x). That is, we have all the conditions for an ordinary renewal 
28 Renewal theory 
process, except that the time from the origin to the first failure has a 
different distribution from the other failure-times. We call such a 
process a modified renewal process. 
One particular situation in which a modified process arises is when 
the component in use at time ^ = 0 is not new. In particular, suppose 
that the time origin is taken a time y after the start of an ordinary 
renewal process. Then the final failure-time in the modified renewal 
process will have the properties of the random variable, Vy, defined 
in section 1. Further the number of renewals in (0, t) in the modified 
process will be Ny^y+ti ^^ the notation of (1.2). 
The second new model is a special case of the modified renewal 
process. It will be proved in section 5.3 that, if t is large, the forward 
recurrence time Vf in an ordinary renewal process has the p.d.f. 
^(x)//x, where ^{x) is the survivor function and /x rs the mean failure- 
time. A modified renewal process in which Xi has the p.d.f. ^{x)lix is 
called an equilibrium renewal process. The physical interpretation is as 
follows. Suppose that a simple renewal process is started in the past 
(r -> - oo) remote from the time origin r = 0. If observation of the 
process is started at ^ = 0, the time to the first failure will have the 
p.d.f. ^{x)lii. Thus an equilibrium renewal process can be regarded 
as an ordinary renewal process in which the system has been running 
a long time before it is first observed. Such processes often arise in 
applications. 
If the underlying process is a Poisson process of rate p, then 
^{x) = e'P'', /x = 1/p and the p.d.f. of Xi is thus pe'P"". Thus, for a 
Poisson process, the ordinary renewal process and the associated 
equilibrium process have identical structure. It is easily shown that 
this is not so for any other distribution of failure-time. 
We shall need for the subsequent calculations the Laplace  
transform of ^(x)//x. It follows from (1.3.14) that 
^{^Mltx;s} = —^^^ (1) 
/X5 
In section 1 we defined seven important quantities associated with 
an ordinary renewal process. These definitions apply without change 
to modified and equilibrium renewal processes. So far as possible we 
The fundamental models 29 
shall use the notation of section 1, using a subscript or superscript o, 
moT e where it is necessary to specify that an ordinary, modified or 
equilibrium renewal process is under consideration. 
Real systems that are fairly well represented by Poisson processes 
are of wide occurrence and are well known. The following examples 
are of renewal processes that are not, in general, Poisson processes. 
Example. The simplest illustration of a renewal process is that of a 
component such as an electric light bulb, valve, etc., a component 
being immediately replaced on failure. 
Example. Consider a labour force of w men. Let a 'component' be 
a man,' failure' occurring when the man leaves the job, a replacement 
being made immediately. Suppose that at time ^ = 0, all the men are 
new to the job. Make the further, rather dubious, assumption that all 
failure-times are independent and with the same distribution. Then 
we have m independent ordinary renewal processes in operation 
simultaneously. 
Example. Consider a stage of an industrial process which produces 
an output in batches. As soon as one batch is completed, production 
of the nexc batch starts. Suppose that the times taken to produce a 
batch are independent random variables, all with the same  
distribution. Then we have a renewal process, interpreting 'failure' to mean 
the completion of a batch. 
Some more examples of renewal processes will be given in section 4. 
2.3. The Poisson process 
The formulae for the properties of a renewal process with an arbitrary 
p.d.f. fix) take very simple explicit forms for a Poisson process, i.e. 
when 
fix) = pe'P\ 
and the process is an ordinary, or, equivalently, an equilibrium 
renewal process. Note that because, by (1.2.13), the age-specific 
failure rate for the exponential distribution, pe~P^, is constant and 
equal to p, there is at any time t, sl probability pAt+oiAt) of failure 
occurring in it,t+ At), independently of the age of the component in 
use at time t. Further, since the failure-times of different components 
are independent, the probability just mentioned is independent of the 
30 Renewal theory 
whole previous history of the process up to t. Hence the Poisson 
process could be defined equivalently by the following conditions 
(Feller, 1957, p. 401): 
a. the probability of a renewal in {t,t + At) is pdt + o{At); 
b. the occurrence of renewals in {t,t+ At) is independent of what 
happens in the process before t; 
c. the probability of more than one renewal in {tj+ At) is o{At). 
First, the p.d.f. of 5^ has already been obtained in (1.3.18), being a 
special Erlangian distribution with r stages. An entirely elementary 
proof is suggested in the exercises. 
Secondly, the number of renewals in (0,/), A^/, has a Poisson 
distribution of mean pt, that is 
prob(A^, = m) = ^-^-- (w = 0,1,...). (1) 
m\ 
To obtain (1) from first principles, divide the time interval (0, t) into 
a large number k of small subintervals of length At, where kAt= t. 
As noted in section 1, there is a probability pAt+o(At) of a, renewal 
in any one of these subintervals, and the occurrences in different 
subintervals are independent. Further, the probability of two or more 
events in the same subinterval is o(At). Hence, by the binomial 
probability law, 
prob(A^, = m) = lim ( ]{pAt)'"(l-pAt)^-'" (2) 
and, on writing At= t/k and passing to the limit, (1) is obtained. 
Two important properties of the Poisson distribution, for which 
there are corresponding results when the p.d.f. f(x) is arbitrary, are 
(a) as ^-> 00, the distribution of A^, is asymptotically normal; 
(b) the ratio var(A^^)/£'(A^^) is constant and equal to one. 
It follows directly from (1) that 
: H(t) = pt^tlii, h(t) = p=\lii. (3) 
Further, the rth semi-invariant of AT, is equal to ^//x. 
The fundamen tal models 31 
It remains to calculate the distributions of the recurrence-times, 
Ut and Vf. The p.d.f. of Vt is p^~^^, because, measuring from time t, 
the age-specific failure rate is constant and equal to p and (1.2.11) then 
gives the p.d.f. of the time up to the first subsequent failure. 
To find the distribution of the backward recurrence time, t/,, note 
first that Ut= tii and only if no renewals occur in (0, t), that is 
prob(t/, = 0 = ^W = e-P\ (4) 
Next, x< Ut<x+Ax if and only if a renewal occurs in {t—x, 
t—x+ Ax) and the new component survives until after /. Hence 
prob(x < Ut< x+Ax) - h{t-x)^{x)Ax = pe'P'^Ax, (5) 
by (3) and (4). Thus Uj has an exponential distribution censored at t; 
that is, with all the probability in (^ oo) collected in a discrete lump 
at /. As ^-> 00, Ut has as its limiting distribution the original  
exponential distribution. 
2.4. Some further examples of renewal processes 
We can now give, using the properties of the Poisson process, a 
number of important examples of renewal processes. 
Example. Suppose that there is a stream of particles occurring in a 
Poisson process of rate p. Consider a counter that works according 
to the following rules. At ^ = 0, the counter is blocked and remains 
blocked for a time X{ having a p.d.f./i(x). Any particle arriving in 
this time is not recorded. At time X{, the counter is open and the next 
particle to arrive, after a further time A^j, is counted. Since the 
particles occur in a Poisson process, X'l has p.d.f. pe'P"",  
independently of X{. The cycle is now repeated, the counter being blocked for 
a time X2, and then being open for a time X 2, before the next particle 
is counted. Assume that X2 is independent of X{ and has the same 
p.d.f.,/i(jc). In general the interval between the (/— l)th and rth  
particles counted is X^ + X'-. If we regard the counting of a particle as a 
'failure', we have an ordinary renewal process, the p.d.f. of failure- 
time being the convolution oifi(x) with pe~P^. If we start with the 
counter open, we have a modified renewal process in which the iirst 
failure-time has p.d.f. pe~P^. 
32 Renewal theory 
This system is called the Type 1 counter. The main interest is in 
correcting the observed count in time t for blocked time. An  
interesting special case is when the blocked time is constant y, so that 
the p.d.f. of failure-time is a displaced exponential distribution 
pg-p(^-y) (^x> y). However, in practice, this case would often be 
dealt with by switching out the counter for time y following each 
particle counted. No problem of correcting for blocked time would 
then arise. 
Example. Consider a counter in which, for simplicity, we suppose 
the blocked time generated by a particle is a constant, y. Suppose, 
however, that instead of the system of the previous example, a particle 
arriving at time t' during a blocked period extends the blocked period 
until t'+y. That is, the counter does not become free until there has 
been a period y, without a particle arriving. The sequence of particles 
counted is again, for a Poisson process of particles, a renewal process, 
but now the p.d.f. of failure-time is the convolution of an exponential 
distribution with the distribution governing the time from the 
counting of a particle to the counter next becoming unblocked. This 
system is called a Type II counter; there are many generalizations. 
Example. Consider a queueing process in which customers arrive 
randomly. Suppose, for simplicity, that there is just one server and 
that the times taken to serve different customers are independent 
random variables all with the same distribution. Suppose that at ^ = 0 
the server has just become free. Say that a failure occurs at an instant 
when the server becomes free. ,Then the times between different 
failures are independent, because of the structure of the process, and 
have a characteristic probability distribution which is the convolution 
of an exponential distribution and the so-called busy-period  
distribution. Hence we have an ordinary renewal process. 
Example. Suppose that we have a stochastic process in continuous 
time and a particular state Eq of the process. Consider the sequence 
of instants at which the process just enters £"0. If the intervals between 
these instants are independently distributed all with the same  
distribution, we have a renewal process. The random variables defined in 
section 2 then give, for example, the number of times £"0 is entered in 
time t, the length of time from t until the state £"0 is next entered, and 
soon.

2.5. The time up to the rth renewal 
(i) General formulae 
The main properties of renewal processes are discussed in subsequent 
chapters. It is, however, convenient to deal immediately with 5^, the 
time of occurrence of the rth renewal, given for ordinary, modified 
and equilibrium renewal processes by 
Sr= X^^.,. + Xr. (1) 
Hence, likXx) is the p.d.f., KXx) the cumulative distribution function 
of5„ 
k*As)=f\{s){f*{s)y'\ (2) 
In the ordinary renewal process,/"J(5) =/*(5), so that 
k^'?*{s) = {/*(5)}^ (3) 
The corresponding formula for the equilibrium renewal process is, 
after using (2.1), 
[JLS 
Now the inverse relation to (3) is 
k['\x)=f^4xl (5) 
/(^)(x) being the r-fold convolution of/(a:), discussed in section 1.3. 
Equation (1.3.12) gave a simple relation between the Laplace  
transform of a function and the Laplace transform of its integral, and from 
this it follows that the inverse relation to (4) is that 
k^;\x) = {F(,_ i)(x) - F(,)(x)}//., (6) 
where F(r)(x) is the cumulative distribution function corresponding 
to/(^)(x). 
(ii) Special cases 
If the distribution of failure-times is of the special Erlangian form 
(L4.1) with a stages, so that 
\p + s)' 
/*(^) = K- h (7) 
34 Renewal theory 
(3)-(6) take quite simple forms. First, in the ordinary renewal process, 
S^°^ has the special Erlangian distribution with ra stages and the same 
parameter p. This is clear immediately from the Laplace transform, 
or from the 'stage' interpretation of failure. For in order that r  
renewals occur, exactly ra stages must be completed and the distribution 
of Sr is hence known from the theory of the Poisson process. 
To simplify (6), the p.d.f. for the equilibrium renewal process, we 
can use (1.4.10) expressing F(^)(^) in terms of the Poisson distribution. 
It follows, since fi = a/p, that 
^^ ml a 
m = ar—a 
which for moderate values of r, a and px is convenient for numerical 
work, using tables of the Poisson distribution. 
When the distribution of failure-time is of the general Erlangian 
form, so that/*(5) is a rational function of 5, the transforms (3) and 
(4) are rational and hence can be inverted in terms of simple functions. 
The same applies to the modified renewal process, provided that 
both/i(jc) and/(jc) are in the general Erlangian family. 
Especially simple results are obtained for the modified renewal 
process if both fi(x) and f(x) are special Erlangian distributions, 
having the same rate parameter p. 
(iii) Asymptotic results 
If the distribution of failure-time has mean /x and variance cr^, it 
follows from the central limit theorem (Cramer, 1946, p. 213) that 
as r-^ 00, the random variable 5^ is asymptotically normally  
distributed with mean /xr and standard deviation aVr. That is, for every 
fixed >' 
y 
lim prob(5, < iir+yaVr) = -^ | e'"'l^du = G{y\ (9) 
r-^oo V(27r) J 
— 00 
say. If the distribution of failure-time has infinite variance, the 
limiting distribution will be a stable law (Loeve, 1960, p. 326; Lukacs, 
1960, p. 97). 
The fundamental models 35 
An Edgeworth expansion (Cramer, 1946, p. 227) or the saddle-point 
method (Daniels, 1954) can be used to improve and assess the 
adequacy of the approximation 
prob (5, < jc) - G ^ (10) 
\(Ty/r I 
based on (9). The asymptotic result (10) applies to ordinary, modified 
and equilibrium renewal processes. An improved approximation, 
based for example on an Edgeworth expansion, will, however, be 
different for the three processes. 
CHAPTER 3 
The Distribution of the Number 
of Renewals 
3.1. Some general formulae 
In order to study A^,, the number of renewals in (0, r), it is simplest to 
use the connexion between A^, and the random variable 5^, the time 
up to the rth renewal, studied in section 2.5. For it is clear from the 
definitions of A^^ and S^ that 
A^, < r if and only if S^ > t. (1) 
Thus prob(A^, < r) = prob(5^ > i) 
= \-KXt\ (2) 
where Ky.(x) is the cumulative distribution function of S^. Hence 
VrohiN, = r) = KXt)-Kr+x{t\ (3) 
with ^o(0 = 1- Therefore the probability distribution of A^, can be 
obtained explicitly for all r. Equation (3) is, in particular, very suitable 
for computing the probability distribution of A^, numerically for small 
values of r. 
The simplest special case of (2) is obtained by taking the renewal 
process to be a Poisson process of rate p. Then, by (1.3.18), Sy has the 
special Erlangian distribution with r stages. Also it is known, from 
the elementary argument in section 2.3, that A^^ has the Poisson 
distribution of mean pt. Equation (2) then states the relation (1.4.10) 
between the sum of terms in the Poisson distribution and the  
incomplete gamma integral. 
Suppose next that we have an ordinary renewal process with the 
failure-time distribution of the special Erlangian type with a stages. 
Then N^^^ = r if and only if the number of stages completed in the 
36 
The distribution of the number of renewals 37 
underlying Poisson process has one of the values ra, ra+1, ... , 
m + a-1. Hence, since the number of stages completed in time t 
follows a Poisson distribution of mean pt, 
prob(M''> = r) = y ^ , . (4) 
m — ra 
An alternative simple algebraic proof can be based on section 
2.5 (ii). 
It is convenient to defer to the next section discussion of nY^, the 
number of renewals in the corresponding equilibrium renewal 
process. 
3.2. The probability generating function 
For some purposes it is convenient to convert (1.3) into an equation 
for the probability generating function of A^,. Let 
(^(^0= 2 rprob(7V, = r) (1) 
r = 0 
= 1+2 r-Hc-i)j^xo. (2) 
r = l 
Now if the Laplace transform with respect to t oikXt) is k*{s), then 
that oiKy{t) is k*is)ls. Hence, on applying a Laplace transformation 
to (2), we have that

The formula (3) applies to ordinary, modified and equilibrium 
renewal processes. By the results of section 2.5, the function k*{s) is 
equal, for those three processes, to {f*{s)y, to f\{s){f*{s)y~ ^ and to 
{\—f*{s)}{f^{s)y~^l{lis). Hence, we have for the ordinary renewal 
process

For small values of r and a, these formulae are convenient for 
numerical calculation, working from tables of cumulative sums of 
the Poisson distribution. 
It follows from (4), (5) and (6) that whenever/*(5), and if relevant 
f\{s), are rational functions of 5, the Laplace transform of the 
generating function can be expanded in partial functions and hence 
inverted in terms of elementary functions. 
40 Renewal theory 
3.3. The asymptotic distribution of Nt 
A simple general result about the limiting distribution of AT, as r -^ oo 
can be obtained directly from (1.2), which links the random variables 
Nf and 5^, and from (2.5.9) which gives the limiting distribution of 
5^, as r -^ 00. The argument applies equally to ordinary, modified and 
equilibrium renewal processes and assumes only that the variance of 
the distribution of life-time is finite. 
Write 
Then 
prob(iV, < r,) = prob(5^^ > 0 (1) 
Now fix >', = >' and let ^ -> oo. Then we have from (2) that 
lim prob(A^f < r,) = lim prob ^ * / > -y 
= G(y\ (3) 
by the asymptotic normality of 5^. Thus we have proved that Nt is 
asymptotically normally distributed with mean t/fi and variance 
(P'tly?. There is a minor analytical difficulty in the above argument 
in that, since r, must be an integer, we ought really to consider a 
limiting process in which y^ = >;+€,, where c, is the smallest value 
such that r^ is an integer. 
Again the simplest special case is for the Poisson process of rate p, 
for which cr = /x = 1 /p. The limiting normal distribution has mean 
and variance equal to pt. This is the familiar limiting normal form of 
the Poisson distribution (Feller, 1957, p. 176). It happens here that 
the exact and asymptotic means and variances are equal. 
It follows from the form of the asymptotic mean and variance that 
for the limiting distribution 
variance a^t fju a^

The distribution of the number of renewals 41 
This generalizes to an arbitrary renewal process the familiar property 
of the Poisson distribution that 
variance _ 
mean 
Of course, (4) is a limiting result only, whereas (5) is exact. 
To use the limiting result (3) numerically we need to know how 
large t has to be before the normal approximation is adequate. This 
can be assessed either by investigating special cases in which the exact 
distribution of A^, can be computed, or by calculating the standard 
measures of non-normality, in particular the y\ measure of skewness 
(section 4.6). For numerical work with the distribution of A^„ using 
a normal approximation, it would usually be preferable to work 
directly from (1.2) and the normal approximation to the distribution 
of Sr, i.e. 
\<jVrl 
prob(Ar, <r)^ 1_G(--^|. (6) 
As an example, consider the Type I counter (section 2.4). Let /xi 
and cr 1 be the mean and variance of blocked time. Then the mean and 
variance of failure-time are /xi + 1/p and erf + 1/p^, where p is the rate 
of arrival of particles. Hence A^„ the number of particles counted in 
time t, is asymptotically normally distributed with mean and variance 
respectively 
pt ^^^ (1J-_.1pV. (,) 
1+/X1P (1+/X1P)' 
A large-sample estimate of p can therefore be obtained by equating 
the mean and A^„ i.e. by writing 
t-Nttix 
This formula for /S has an obvious intuitive explanation, since N^yii 
is the expected amount of blocked time arising from Nj counts. For 
42 Renewal theory 
the original Poisson process of particles, variance/mean = 1, whereas 
from (7) 
var(7V,) (l + afp^) 
E(N,) (l+/xip)2 
(9) 
If cTj < jLtj, which would normally be so, expression (9) is less than 
one, so that there is apparent under-dispersion relative to the Poisson 
distribution. 
3.4. The number of renewals in a random time 
So far we have considered the number Nt of renewals in a fixed 
interval (0, t). Suppose now that Tis a random variable independent of 
the renewal process {A"i, X2,...} and that A^is the number of renewals 
in (0, T). Ifq{t) is the p.d.f. of Tand G(t, 0 the probability generating 
function of A^„ the probability generating function of A^ is 
00 
GiO = j G(t,Ogit)dt. (1) 
0 
Example. Let Tbe the life-time of a whole piece of equipment. The 
number of renewals of a particular component required in this time 
is N. It is assumed that the process determining the life-time of the 
whole equipment is independent of the failure of components. 
Example. Skellam and Shenton (1957) mention the following 
problem connected with the degradation of polymer chains. Consider 
molecules whose length T is a random variable. When one end of a 
molecule is activated, links of the chain split off until a side reaction 
stops the process. Let the lengths split off in successive activations be 
independent random variables {Xi, X2, ...} all with the same  
distribution. Then N-\-1 is the number of activations necessary to  
disintegrate one molecular chain. 
Suppose that the p.d.f. q{t) is of the special Erlangian type with 
k stages. 
The distribution of the number of renewals 43 
The mean and coefficient of variation of Tare thus kjX and Xj^k. 
The argument to be given below is easily generalized if ^(0 is a linear 
combination of expressions (2). 
Now 
00 
G*{sX) = ^G{tX)e-''dt, 
0 
so that I 1 G*(5,0 = J G{t, I)t^-^ e-''dt. 
(3) 
This formula can in fact be given a meaning for non-integral A: by a 
suitable definition of derivatives of fractional order. It follows from 
(l)-(3)that 
We can now substitute in (4) the expressions (2.4)-(2.6) for the 
Laplace transform G*(5,1) for ordinary, modified and equilibrium 
renewal processes. We deal here only with ordinary renewal  
processes, for which 
Suppose first that k=\, i.e. that Thas an exponential distribution. 
Then 
so that the distribution of A^ is geometric with common ratio/*(A), 
where A = \IE{T), There is a simple generalization of this result if the 
p.d.f. of ris a linear combination of exponential terms. 
44 Renewal theory 
Another simple special case occurs when the underlying renewal 
process is a Poisson process,/*(5) = p/(p + s). Then 
a negative binomial distribution. More generally, if the distribution 
of failure-time is of the special Erlangian type with a stages, fairly 
simple results can be obtained from (5) provided that k and a are both 
rather small. 
CHAPTER 4 
The Moments of the Number of Renewals 
4.1. The renewal function 
In the present chapter we consider the moments, and especially the 
mean value, of A^^, the number of renewals in the time interval (0, t). 
The renewal function, H{tX defined as EiNf), is given by 
r = 0 
= i KM, (1) 
after using (3.1.3) for the probability distribution of A^^. On taking 
Laplace transforms, it follows, in the notation of section 3.2, that 
1 x:^ 1/ ' \ ,* ^-' 
^*(*) = - 2, ^*^*>- '^^^■' (2) 
We now deal separately with ordinary, modified and equilibrium 
renewal processes. In fact, the answer is simplest for the equilibrium 
process and therefore we consider that first. In this case 
kf{s) = {l-f*is)}{f*is)V-'lifjLsl 
and it follows that 
1 _ f*(c\ ^^-^ 
l-/*(5)

r=l 
[45]

Therefore, by (1.3.8), 
Renewal theory 
(3) 
Hence, for any equilibrium renewal process the expected number of 
renewals in (0,0 is proportional to t. More generally, because the 
number of renewals in {t, t') is Nf — Nt, it follows that the expected 
number of renewals in any interval is proportional to the length of 
the interval. 
Consider now an ordinary renewal process, for which 
kf'Ks) = {/*(^)}^ 
Then ^*(,)= AAj' (4) 
s{^ -/*(5)} 
It follows incidentally from (4) that a given function H(t) can be the 
renewal function for at most one distribution of failure-time. 
Equation (4) can be inverted exactly in simple cases. For the 
Poisson process,/*(5) = pl{s + p) and we find that 
Ho(t) = tIfjL = tp. (5) 
Note that in contrast to the equilibrium renewal process, the Poisson 
process is the only ordinary renewal process for which H{t) is  
proportional to t. 
For the special Erlangian distribution of failure-time, with 
/*(5) = p«/(^+j)«,wehave 
The general result, analogous to (4), for a modified renewal process 
is 
H*is)= ,,),'' (7)

4.2. The asymptotic form of the renewal function 
Consider now the form of the function Hoit) for large t. To study this, 
we examine the behaviour of the Laplace transform H*(s) for small s 
The moments of the number of renewals 47 
and apply theUauberian argumentsoutlined in section 1.3 (iv). Now 
if jLt and a are the mean and standard deviation of failure-time, then,

Hence 
1 ^ Xa'-i? ^I\\ 
s^fjL s 2fjL^ \sj 
Formal inversion of (2) gives that as ^ -^oo 
Ho{t) = -+-^ + o{\\ (3) 
Equation (3) is in fact true provided that cP" is finite, although, as 
noted in section 1.3 (iv), a rigorous justification is difficult. However, 
a rigorous proof that Hoit) '^ tl^i is fairly easy, because Ho{t) is a 
monotone function of t. 
Some general qualitative conclusions can be reached from (3). 
{a) If cr = jLt, then Ho{t) = tlfi + o{l). This generalizes the result for 
the exponential distribution, a particular distribution with cr = /x, for 
which Hoit) = t/fi, 
(b) If cr < jLt, the second term in (3) will be negative, and in  
particular if cr <^ jLt, we have 
^,(0 ^ ^^ + ^(1). (4) 
This can be given a simple intuitive meaning in that to start with a 
new component rather than an 'average' component is equivalent to 
saving one-half a failure. 
(c) If cr > jLt, the second term in (3) is positive. The intuitive meaning 
here is that a distribution with coefficient of variation of more than 
one is likely to have appreciable probability near zero failure-time, 
and that to start with a new component is therefore worse than to 
start with an 'average' component. 
48 Renewal theory 
To use (3) numerically we need to know how rapidly the asymptotic 
result is approached. The following rough argument is applicable 
when cr <^ jLt. The first renewal is quite likely to occur in the range 
(jLt—cr, jLt + cr). Hence H^it) changes from near zero to near one as t 
moves through the interval. The second renewal is quite likely to 
occur in the interval (2/>t - cr a/2, 2/>t + cr V2) and the rth renewal in the 
interval (rfi—a^r^rfi-^-ay^r). Now it is clear that (3) will be  
inadequate so long as the rth interval has little overlap with the (r— l)th 
and the (r+ l)th. A reasonable minimum requirement for the  
applicability of (3) is therefore that r should be such that 
a\/r > [JL, i.e. r > ft^/cr^. 
In terms of tc^ ryu, this means 
t > p?l<j'. (5) 
We shall make a more detailed investigation of this in the next section. 
4.3. A more detailed study of the renewal function 
The study of Ho{t) from its Laplace transform (1.4) is typical of many 
problems arising in renewal theory. It will therefore be discussed in 
some detail in this section, partly in order to illustrate the methods 
to be followed in dealing with other similar problems. We work all 
the time from the equation 
s{\-f*{s)} 
First suppose that the distribution of failure-time is Erlangian, so 
that f*{s) is a rational function of 5, i.e. is the ratio of two  
polynomials. Then so too is H*{s). We can therefore split H*(s) into 
partial fractions^ obtaining terms 
(a) from the pole at 5 = 0, 
(b) from the poles at 5i, ^2* • • • > the non-zero roots of the equation 
£(^-^^) 4f*(s) = 1.1 (2) 
Now (2) has a simple root at 5 = 0, since/*'(0) = — ft < 0. Hence 
the partial fraction expansion of (1) contains terms in 1/5^ and I/5 and 
The moments of the number of renewals 49 
these are exactly the terms obtained in the general asymptotic 
expansion (2.2). That is 
^*(^) = ;2-+:-^+^?(^X (3) 
1 1 (p--y} 
1 
S^fJL S IfJ? 
where A*{s) is a rational function of s with poles at Si, S2, .... It 
follows from (2) that complex sj must occur in conjugate pairs and 
that Re (5;) < 0. For the last point, note that if Re (5) > 0 
00 00 
|/*(5)| ^ J \e-'^\fix)dx < jfMdx = 1. 
0 0 
A separate argument easily shows that there can be no purely 
imaginary roots of (2), when failure-time is continuously distributed. 
We draw three conclusions for Erlangian distributions. 
(i) In principle (3) can be inverted explicitly in finite terms. When 
A*{s) is in partial fractions, a simple root Sj gives a term proportional 
to 1/(5-5;), inverting into e^^'. A multiple root leads to a term t^e^^^. 
Since Re (5;) < 0 these terms tend to zero exponentially fast as f-> 00. 
(ii) The limiting formulae (2.3) is therefore rigorously proved and 
the error term is exponentially small in t. 
(iii) When the full inversion of (3) is very complicated, we can find 
the next term to (2.3) by taking the non-zero roots of (2) with largest 
real part. There are three main cases: 
(a) a single simple (real) root si leads to a correction term  
proportional to e*'^; 
(b) a pair of conjugate complex simple roots 5i, 52 = 5' ± is" leads 
to a correction term proportional to e^'^cos{s''t-\-e); 
(c) a single multiple root si of order r +1 leads to a correction term 
proportional to t^e^^^. 
If Sj is a simple non-zero root of (2), the corresponding term in the 
partial fraction expansion of (1) is 
(4) 
Sjf*XSj){s-Sj) 
since f*(Sj) = 1. 
50 Renewal theory 
Consider two simple examples. Suppose first that the p.d.f. of 
failure-time is a mixture of two exponential distributions (section 
1.4 (iv)), so that 
Pl + 5 P2+S 
Here the equation (2) has roots 0 and 5i = — {(1 — ^)pi + 6p2}. The 
expansion of (3) is 
^;w= 2-+- 
-fjL^ e{\-e){p,-p2f 
so that 
Hoit) = ^^-S^^^S^^ 
(6) 
As a second example, consider the special Erlangian distribution 
with three stages, having/*(5) = p^/(p + 5)^. Then the equation (2) 
reduces to 
5(5^+3p5+3p^) = 0, (7) 
so that the non-zero roots are at 
SuS2 = -:^P±i—p> (8) 
By (4), we have that

The moments of the number of renewals 51 
For the a-stage Erlangian distribution we have to consider the a — 1 
non-zero roots of {s-vpY = p" and these are 
p{exp {lirkila) -1} (A: = 1,..., a -1). 
An alternative way of looking at these formulae is in terms of the 
complex inversion formula of section 1.3 (iii). The line of integration 
is converted into a closed contour by a large semicircle to the left of 
the imaginary axis, and the various terms in Hoif) arise from the poles 
of H%{s) at 5 = 0, 5i, 52,.... 
This argument extends with little difficulty if H*{s) has an infinite 
number of poles in the negative half-plane. The partial fraction 
expansion in a finite series is replaced by an infinite series, the so-called 
Mittag-Leffier series, and provided some convergence conditions are 
satisfied, the only change in Ho{t) is that the finite series of exponential 
terms becomes an infinite series. The non-zero pole of H%{s) with 
largest real part still plays an important role. 
The next situation to consider is when/*(5) has a branch point. 
For instance if the failure-time has a F distribution. 
/*W

and if a is non-integral there is a branch point at 5 = —p. For  
simplicity we consider the special case a = J, for which the equation (2) 
has no non-zero roots, the branch point being the only non-zero 
singularity of H*o{s)\ 
We apply the complex inversion formula, but in completing the 
line into a closed contour we must exclude the branch point. This is 
achieved by taking the contour C shown in Fig. 4.1. We consider C 
as starting at 5 = c on the real axis with ^/{\ + sjp) defined as real and 
positive there. Then

Now the integral in (11) is 0(t~^^^) for large t, so that the error in 
the general asymptotic formula is 0{e~P*t~'^^^). 
By a similar argument, if H%{s) has both poles and branch points 
there will be an (approximately) exponential approach to the  
asymptotic form (2.3), the dominant term being determined by the non-zero 
singularity with largest real part. 
It can be shown that if ft and cr^ are finite, but not all moments are 
finite, the approach to (2.3) is like some power of Xjt, 
4.4. The renewal density 
The renewal density, h{t), was defined in section 2.1. Its physical 
interpretation is that h{t) At is asymptotically the chance of a renewal 
in the interval {t, t-\- At). Mathematically, h{t) is most easily calculated 
as the derivative of H{t), so that from (1.1) 
hit) = S kr(t), (1) 
r=l 
as can be seen directly from the consideration that kXt)At is the 
probability that the rth renewal occurs in (t,t+ At). It follows easily 
that for an equilibrium renewal process the renewal density is constant 
and equal to l//>t. 
54 Renewal theory 
For an ordinary renewal process 
hl{s) = £ {f\s)Y 
r—\ 
whereas for a modified renewal process 
(2) 
These also follow directly from (1.4) and (1.3.13). 
An alternative interpretation of (2) and (3) follows on writing (3) as 
hUs)=ftis) + hUs)f*{s). (4) 
Invert (4) and recall from section 1.3 that the Laplace transform of a 
convolution is the product of the separate Laplace transforms. Then 
we have that 
hmit) = fi{t) + jh^{t-u)f{u)du, (5) 
0 
or, for the ordinary renewal process, 
Kit) = f{t) + jho{t-u)f{u)du. (6) 
0 
This is called the integral equation of renewal theory, and in some 
treatments of the subject is taken as the starting point. For a direct 
probabilistic proof of (6) note that the probability of a renewal in 
{t,t+ At) is the sum of 
(a) the probability, f{t) At, that the first renewal is in {t,t+ At)\ 
(jb) the sum over u of the probability that there is a renewal near 
/—M followed by a failure-time of length w. 
The moments of the number of renewals 55 
The limiting result for the renewal density analogous to those of 
section 2 for the renewal function is that 
lim hit) = -• (7) 
/-►oo /^ 
This limit is easily derived formally by letting 5-^0 in (2) or (3). A 
rigorous proof for distributions in the general Erlangian family can 
be obtained by applying the complex inversion formula and  
calculating the contribution from the simple pole of h*{s) at 5 = 0. A 
rigorous proof for very general distributions of failure-time is  
difficult, although the result (7) is true under very mild restrictions on the 
p.d.f. of failure-time. 
It is possible to show by examples that in approaching its limit l//x 
the function hjj) may 
[a) be strictly increasing, 
{b) be strictly decreasing, 
or (c) oscillate around l//x. 
It is clear on general grounds that (c) will arise when the distribution 
of failure-time has relatively small dispersion. For then hoif) will tend 
to be large near ^ = /x, 2/x, ... and tend to be small near ^ = 0, f/x, 
f/x, .... The rapidity with which the oscillations will die out will 
depend on the dispersion of the distribution. 
4.5. The variance of the number of renewals 
In section 3.3 we showed that the limiting normal distribution of Nf 
has variance (P'tly?. We now examine the variance in more detail. 
Results are obtained in simplest algebraic form by working not 
directly with the variance of Nf or with the second moment of Nt 
about the origin, but instead with 
ilsU) = E{NAN,+ \)}. (1) 
Clearly var(iV,) = ilsit)-H{t)-H\t). ' (2)

For an ordinary renewal process, k*{s) = {f*(s)Y, so that 
,,,, 2f*is) 
whereas for an equilibrium renewal process, with 
k*(.s) = {f*(s)Y-Hl-^(.s)}Ks^i), 
there is a corresponding result for a modified renewal process. There 
is a simple relation between (5) and the Laplace transform (1.4) of 
the renewal function in the ordinary renewal process. In fact 
Thus, from (1.3.8) and (1.3.11), 
W) = -f^»rf«+-- (6) 
The moments of the number of renewals 57 
Since for the equilibrium renewal process Hgit) = ///x, we have from 
(6) that 
var(Ar(^>) = - f j^,(M)-- + ^jdu. (7) 
0 
An incidental consequence of (7) is that, for every t. 
We (^»-~ 
Ave {HM-'~^\ > 0, (8) 
with equality if and only ifNJ^^ is a degenerate random variable. Thus, 
in this average sense, Hoit) lies above the line y = tlfi—^. 
As usual, the simplest special case is the Poisson process, for which 
with/*(^) = pl(p + s), we have that 
m=0?(.)=?^^ (9) 
whence 0^(0 = WO = p'^t^+lpt, 
leading, with (2), to yet another proof that the variance of the Poisson 
distribution of mean pt is also equal to pt. 
It follows, by arguments that should now be familiar, that we can 
invert explicitly whenever/*(5) is a "rational function of 5jand can 
obtain asymptotic forms as /->oo, first by examining behaviour as 
5->0 and then by considering the contribution from the non-zero 
roots of the equation/*(5) = 1 with largest real parts. Thus for the 
special Erlangian distribution with two stages, we have 
^"^'^ s\s+2pf

and, since, from (1.4) 
Hoit) = E{N}'^) = ipt-i + ie-^P\ 
we have that 
var(Ar/^>) = ipt+ ■is-ipte-^P'-'ise-'^P'. (11) 
For the corresponding equilibrium renewal process, we have 
directly from (7) that 
var(Ar/^>) = - \ {i+ie-^P")du 
0 
= ipt+i-ie-''P'. (12) 
The corresponding asymptotic results are derived in general by 
expanding (4) and (5) near 5 = 0. We have that 
Therefore, formally, by the argument of section 1.3 (iv), 
Then, since Hoit) = ///x + Ha^ - iJ?')ly?' + o{\) and He{t) = ///x, we have 
from (2) that 
v.,<A-<'>)-^'+(!+^^.-0)+o(l). (18) 
The moments of the number of renewals 59 
In deriving (17) it has to be assumed that the term o{\) in HJiJ) is in 
fact o{t~ ^). This is true when />t3 < oo (Smith, 1959); as indicated in 
section 3 the term is often exponentially small. 
These results are easily proved rigorously for distributions of 
failure-time that have rational Laplace transforms. The leading 
terms in the expressions (11) and (12) for the special Erlangian 
distribution with two stages are easily recovered as special cases. 
4.6. The higher moments 
In principle the arguments of the previous sections extend to the 
calculation of the higher moments or semi-invariants of AT,. For 
example, the Laplace transform of therth factorial moment of AT^ can 
be obtained by differentiating G*(5, Q r times with respect to t, 
at£=l. 
The general asymptotic result (Smith, 1959) is that the rth semi- 
invariant of A^, has the form 
K,{N;) = Kt + v, + o{\\ (1) 
where A^ is a function of the first r moments of failure-time and v^ is 
a function of the first r + 1 moments. The value of A^, but not of v^, is 
the same for ordinary, modified and equilibrium renewal processes. 
The asymptotic proportionality to / is intuitively very plausible, 
because the numbers of renewals in long adjacent intervals are nearly 
independent. Hence a semi-invariant for the number of renewals in 
the combined interval is nearly the sum of the semi-invariants for the 
separate intervals, and this implies asymptotic proportionality to 
/in(l). 
The leading coefficient A^ is most easily derived by using a result 
from the general theory of random walk, the so-called fundamental 
identity of sequential analysis (Wald, 1947, p. 159). The argument 
used here is different in type from those in the remainder of this book, 
because an essential property of renewal processes, that the random 
variables Xi are positive, is not used. However, it is probably not 
possible to obtain the constants v^, or exact results about A^„ from 
Wald's identity. 
60 Renewal theory 
In the notation of renewal theory, the fundamental identity is 
E[txv>{-sSM-M,logf*{s)}] = 1, (2) 
where Mt = Nt+l is the number of failures at the first renewal point 
past t and 5^^ is the corresponding time. The proof follows Wald's 
exactly and will not be given here. For large t we can write in (2), 
Mt -' A^„ SMt '^ ^- Then we have that 
log£'[exp{-M,log/*(5)}] - St, 
or log E[Qxp { -pMt}] - ta(pl (3) 
where aip) is the solution for s of the equation 
log/*(5) = p, 
i.e. log/*{<^0^)} = p. (4) 
The left-hand side of (3) is the semi-invariant generating function of 
Mf, i.e. the rth semi-invariant is the coefficient of {—pYlrl. Also 
^og f*{s) is the semi-invariant generating function of failure-time, so 
that if Kr is the rth semi-invariant of failure-time (4) is 
s^ s^ 
'-K1S + K2--K2 — + ... =/?. 
The solution for s in terms ofp is obtained by reversion of series as 
P ,'<2P^ ( '<^3, 3/c^\/?^ //C4 15/c| 10/ci/c3\/ 
' ■" ^^/c?2!~r/ct^^/3!^W^^ ;^/4!"----^^^ 
Tables for facilitating the calculation of (5) are available; see, for 
example, Bleick (1942). It follows from (4) and (5) that the first four 
semi-invariants of A^^ are asymptotically 
L, ^, ,M^A and ti^^'-^^J^]. (6) 
CHAPTER 5 
Recurrence-Times 
5.1. The backward recurrence-time 
We recall that the backward recurrence-time Ut was defined in 
section 2.1 to be the age of the component in use at time t. 
Example. Suppose that we have a number of independent  
realizations of the same renewal process, for example a number of  
components of the same type in use on different machines. Suppose that 
to investigate the distribution of failure-time a survey is made at 
time t to obtain the ages of the components currently in use. The 
distribution of the observations will be that of i/,. 
Now if there is no renewal in (0, t), Ut is equal to t. Hence 
prob(t/, = 0 = ^i(0, (1) 
where ^\{t) is the survivor function for the first component. Next, 
for X < ^ we have, asymptotically in Ax, that the probability that f/, 
lies between (x,x+Jx) is equal to the probability that there is a 
renewal in the interval (t—x—Ax,t—x) and that the component 
introduced then has failure-time greater than x. Thus the p.d.f. of the 
continuous part of the distribution of Ut is 
h{t-x)^ix). (2) 
The special case of (1) and (2) applying to a Poisson process was 
discussed in section 2.3. 
Consider now the limiting distribution of Ut as ^-^oo. Since 
^\{t)->0 as ^->oo, the discrete part of the distribution can be 
ignored. Further, for any fixed x, 
lim h{t—x) = 1/jLt, 
by the result of section 4.4. Hence the limiting distribution of Ut has 
p.d.f. 
^W//x. (3) 
[611 
62 Renewal theory 
We call (3) the limiting distribution of (backward) recurrence-time 
and discuss its properties in section 3. 
For the limiting distribution to be a reasonable approximation to 
the distribution of Ut, the time / must be large enough for 
(a) ^i(0 to be negligible; 
(b) the renewal density h{t—x) to be near its limiting value, for all 
X such that ^(x) is appreciable. 
If the mean failure-time, fi, is infinite, Uf has to be standardized by 
a suitable power of t before a limiting distribution is obtained. 
If the renewal process is an equilibrium renewal process, the 
renewal density is constant and equal to l//>t. Hence the exact  
distribution of Uf is the limiting distribution censored at t. This generalizes 
the result found for the Poisson process in section 2.3. 
5.2. The forward recurrence-time 
We now consider the forward recurrence-time, F„ defined as the time 
measured forward from t to the next renewal. In other words, F, is 
the residual life-time of the component in use at t. 
Example. In the example of section 1, suppose that observation of 
a component is started at time / and continued until the component 
fails. The frequency distribution of the observations is that of V^. 
Example. Consider a queueing process in which service is available 
only at service-intervals, which form a renewal process. A customer 
arriving at time t will have to wait a time Vf for the first service-instant. 
Example. For any of the stochastic processes discussed in the 
examples of section 2.4, the time measured from / until the process 
next enters the' zero' state is the forward recurrence-time of a renewal 
process. 
For Vf to lie in the interval {x,x-\- Ax), either 
(a) the first component has failure-time in the interval {t + x, 
t + X+Ax),OT 
(b) for some m, a renewal occurs in the interval {t—u,t—u-\-8u) and 
the component then introduced has failure time in the interval 
(m + X,M + X + Ax). (It is supposed here that Su<Ax<l.) 
Recurrence-times 63 
Therefore the p.d.f. of F, is 
fi{t + x) + ^ Kt-u)f{u + x)du, (1) 
0 
If we consider the limiting distribution as /-^oo, assuming that 
/i(0 -^0 as ^-^ 00, we have for the limiting p.d.f. 
00 00 
- {f{u + x)du = - {Av)dv = —^. (2) 
0 X 
This is the same distribution as found in (1.3) for the backward 
recurrence-time. We can therefore call the p.d.f. (2) the limiting 
distribution of recurrence-time, without specifying whether  
backward or forward recurrence-time is meant. 
Consider the exact result (1) for an equilibrium renewal process. 
We have that 
SO that the p.d.f. is 
- + - f{u + x)au = 
-//,»- 
0 
Thus the limiting distribution of recurrence-time applies exactly, for 
any t, to an equilibrium renewal process. This is clear also from the 
interpretation of an equilibrium renewal process as an ordinary 
renewal process that started a long time before the time origin. 
5.3. The limiting distribution of recurrence-time 
Consider now the p.d.f. ^{x)lii obtained in sections 1 and 2 as the 
limiting distribution of recurrence-time. The distribution is always 
J-shaped; if failure-times arbitrarily close to zero have positive  
probability, there is a unique mode of ^(x)//>t at x = 0. The exponential 
distribution is easily shown to be the only one for which the  
distribution of failure-time coincides with ^{x)lyL. 
64 Renewal theory 
The moments of the limiting distribution of recurrence-time are 
easily found from the Laplace transform, namely from the result 
(2.2.1) that 
^mx)/f^;s} = —^-^' (1) 
SfJL 
Now the rth moment about the origin is the coefficient of (—5)''/r! in 
the Taylor expansion of the Laplace transform. Hence, if m^ and [x^ 
denote the rth moments about the origin of the limiting distribution 
of recurrence-time and of failure-time, then 
-'- ''''+' (2) 
(r+l)^ 
If nir and ju, denote moments about the mean and ct^ = fi2 is the 
variance of failure-time, we have that 
m, . i(;,+i-). 
"-g4-$)4 
-=^?('-?)4(-7V^)- 
(3) 
(4) 
(5) 
In particular, equations (3) and (4) give the mean and variance of the 
limiting distribution of recurrence-time. 
As indicated in the examples in sections 1 and 2, it may sometimes 
be required to obtain the distribution of failure-time from the  
distribution of limiting recurrence-time. There are various ways this can be 
done. One is to fit a smooth curve to the distribution of recurrence- 
time and then to differentiate. For the moments of failure-time we can 
use the reciprocal of the estimated ordinate at x = 0 of the distribution 
of recurrence-time to estimate fi and then the relations (3)-(5) to 
estimate higher moments. Alternatively, a functional form could be 
assumed for one or other distribution and the parameters estimated, 
say by maximum likelihood. One assumption that leads to moderately 
Recurrence-times 65 
simple formulae is that the distribution of failure-time is of the 
WeibuU type (section 1.4). 
If we deal not with the limiting distribution of recurrence-time, but 
with Ut or Vf for finite t, a more complicated analysis is required. 
5.4. An alternative derivation of the limiting distribution 
There is an instructive alternative derivation of the p.d.f. ^{x)ly., 
which we now consider. First associate with the p.d.f./(x) of failure- 
time, the p.d.f. xf(x)/fi, said to correspond to length-biased sampling 
of/W. 
The statistical interpretation is that we sample from a population 
of failure-times distributed according to /(x), the probability of 
selection of any individual in the population being proportional to 
its length, x. It is easily seen that this leads to the p.d.f. xf{x)lyi for 
the failure-time selected. 
Example. An idealized model of a textile yarn is an assembly of 
parallel fibres, with p.d.f. of fibre length,/(x). The fibre left-ends are 
arranged at random along a line. Take a particular cross-section of 
the yarn, i.e. a particular point on the line, and consider the fibres 
that intersect this cross-section. This is length-biased sampling; the 
p.d.f. of length of the fibres selected is xf(x)/fi. 
Example. Suppose that in order to investigate the distribution of 
failure-time in a renewal process we record the age at failure of the 
component in use at some fixed time t, a long time from the start of 
the process. Let this be done for a number of independent realizations 
of the same renewal process (see the examples in sections 1 and 2). 
Then the resulting observations will have the length-biased frequency 
distribution. 
Consider for any renewal process a recurrence-time, W, defined in 
the following way. First, we take a sampling point chosen at random 
over a very long time interval. Then W^is defined as the time measured 
from the sampling point forward to the next renewal. Entirely the 
same properties would hold for the time measured from the sampling 
point back to the previous renewal. It is clear that 
(a) if ^denotes the failure-time of the component in whose life the 
sampling point falls, then ^has the length-biased p.d.f. jc/(x)//x; 
66 Renewal theory 
(b) conditionally on ^= Xq, the p.d.f. of W is rectangular over 
(0,Xo). 
Hence the conditional p.d.f. of Wis 
. 1/Xo (0 ^ X :^ Xq), 
0 (^0 < x). 
Thus the unconditional p.d.f. is 
00 
J 
1 ^o/Uo) , «^W 
^Xq = (1) 
Xq fl /X 
In this approach, the p.d.f. ^(x)/fi is connected with a recurrence- 
time when the sampling point is randomly distributed. In the earlier 
sections, the sampling point was taken as a fixed point, t, remote from 
the time origin. In fact, whenever the distribution of a random 
variable such as i7„ tends to a limit as ^ -> oo, the limiting distribution 
coincides with that of a random variable attained by considering a 
randomly distributed sampling point. 
The argument leading to (1) applies to a much wider class of  
processes than renewal processes. All that is required is that the number 
of failure-times of length (x,x+Ax) should be proportional to 
f{x)Ax; the independence of different failure-times is not required. 
We shall need the more general result in section 6.5. 
5.5. An application to the number of renewals in an arbitrary interval 
A modified renewal process was defined in section 2.2 as having the 
p.d.f. of the first failure-time, Xi, not necessarily the same as that of 
the failure-times X2, X^, One way in which such a process can 
arise is by taking the time origin not immediately after the insertion 
of a new component as in an ordinary renewal process, but instead at 
a time Iq later. The first failure-time in the modified process has then 
the distribution of a forward recurrence-time, F,^, as given by (2.1). 
Certain results for this special modified renewal process are 
obvious. First, 
A^/"' = N^t-Ni:\ (1) 
Recurrence-times 67 
so that H^ {t) = Ho{t + ^) - HM (2) 
and hM = K(t+to). (3) 
Here quantities with suffix or superscript o refer to an ordinary 
renewal process, whereas those with an m refer to the modified 
process starting after time ^. 
Suppose that the distribution of A^}'"^ is required. By (3.2.5) the 
Laplace transform of the probability generating function of N^"^^ in 
an arbitrary modified renewal process is 
where/i(5) is the Laplace transform of the p.d.f. of the first failure- 
time. Denote the corresponding transformed probability generating 
function in our case by G*j(s,t,;tQ), to emphasize its dependence on 
the starting point to. 
Then 
where, by (2.1), 
/f(^;^) = J e'AAto+x) + ^ K%-u)Au^x)duUx. (6) 
Now to simplify (5) and (6) it is natural to apply a Second Laplace 
transformation, this time with respect to t^. Define 
00 
/i*^(^;^o) = J e-'-'-ftis; to)dto (7) 
0 
with a similar definition for G^{s,C;sq). We have directly from (5) 
that 
68 Renewal theory 
Further, it is fairly easy to show, by transforming (6), that 
Sq-S 
Since h*{sQ) refers to an ordinary renewal process, we have by (4.4.2) 
that 
^*(^o) = /^,- (10) 
1 -/*(^o) 
Thus, combining (8)-(10), we have that 
This is a very general result, although it is not too easy to extract 
from it useful explicit formulae that cannot be obtained more simply 
by direct arguments. In principle, however, for general Erlangian 
distributions (11) can be inverted explicitly. A closely related result 
to (11) can be obtained for the function 0^(0 considered in section 4.5 
in connexion with the variance of the number of renewals. In fact if, 
for a modified process starting at ^, 
we have by the arguments of section 4.5 that 
2ft{s;to)

Suppose now that we are concerned with behaviour for large t. We 
therefore expand (13) for small s, writing 
f*{s) = l-fJLS+ifJL2S-ifJLis^ + 
Recurrence-times 69 
We get that, as 5->0,

We have now to invert the Laplace transformation with argument sq.

Thus the calculation of the limiting variance as ^ -> oo requires only 
the calculation of the renewal function of the corresponding ordinary 
renewal process.

In the previous chapters we have considered in detail the theory of the 
ordinary renewal process and of two simple generalizations in which 
the distribution of the first life-time is different from that of the other 
failure-times. We deal in the next few chapters more briefly with a 
number of further generalizations of the ordinary renewal process. 
These are 
(i) in the present chapter, a process formed by superposing several 
ordinary renewal processes; 
(ii) in Chapter 7 an alternating renewal process in which there are 
components of two types, not necessarily with the same distribution 
of failure-time, and in which a component of one type is always 
replaced on failure by a component of the other type; 
(iii) in Chapter 8, a cumulative process, in which with the zth 
failure in an ordinary renewal process is associated a random variable, 
IVi, which may or may not be correlated with the failure-time of the 
component. For example, Wi might be the cost of replacing the zth 
component. We then study the cumulative sum of the Wi over all 
failures that have occurred up to the time instant under consideration ; 
(iv) in Chapter 9, some miscellaneous generalizations. 
6.2. The pooled output of several renewal processes 
Suppose that we have p independent ordinary renewal processes in 
operation simultaneously, all with the same p.d.f. of failure time. 
Consider the sequence of renewals formed by pooling the individual 
processes. Figure 6.1 illustrates the special case, p=3. In many 
applications it will be more reasonable to take the individual  
component processes as equilibrium renewal processes. 
Example. Consider an industrial process in one stage of which p 
similar machines operate independently and in parallel. Suppose that 
any one of the machines produces items in a renewal process, i.e. that 
71 
72 
Renewal theory 
the production-times per item are independent random variables with 
a common distribution. Then if the sequences for different machines 
are independent, so that in particular the different machines are not 
kept 'in phase', the sequence of instants at which items are produced 
will be a pooled output of the type under consideration. We may need 
to know the properties of the pooled sequence in order to plan the 
next stage of production. 
Example. In some neurophysiological investigations one is  
concerned with a number of neurons independently sending discrete 
pulses to a common central nerve cell. If it is assumed that the

sequence of pulses from any one neuron forms a renewal process, the 
combined sequence of pulses at the central nerve cell has the structure 
to be analysed below. A similar superposition of sequences arises in 
some types of spontaneous subthreshold activity at motor nerve 
endings. Thus Fatt and Katz (1952) found that at the tips of certain 
many-branching nerve endings, there are a large number of active 
spots, each giving rise to localized electrical pulses in the muscle fibre 
with which they make common contact. 
Example. Suppose that p similar components are in use  
simultaneously and that initially a stock of r-1 spare components is 
available. Then, unless more spares are obtained, the system can 
operate for a time determined by the occurrence of rth renewal in 
the pooled output. 
The superposition of renewal processes 73 
6.3. Some general properties 
If the individual processes are Poisson processes of rate p, the pooled 
process is a Poisson process of rate pp. For, independently of what 
happens before /, the probability of a renewal in (/,/+ At) is easily 
shown to hQ ppAt-\-o{At) and the probability of more than one 
renewal is 6>( J 0- 
Some general properties of the pooled process can be derived 
immediately from the corresponding properties of the individual 
processes. Thus if A^,(p) is the number of renewals in (0, t) in the 
pooled process, 
n,^p^ = n;+n';^...+n\p\ (1) 
where N^'^ is the number of renewals in the zth process. Since the p 
individual processes are independent, the mean, variance and in 
general the semi-invariants of A^,(p) are/? times those of an individual 
process. Similarly, the probability generating function of Ar,(^) is 
{a/,0}^ (2) 
where G(/, 0 refers to an individual process. 
In section 3.1, we used the relation (3.1.1) between AT, and 5,., the 
time up to the rth renewal, to calculate for a single renewal process 
the properties of AT,. Now if 5^(p) denotes the time up to the rth event 
in the pooled process, the properties of 5'^(p) are not directly  
obtainable. We therefore use (3.1.1) in reverse to relate Sr^p-^ to A^/(p). In 
particular the survivor function for Sr(^p) is equal to 
prob(5,(^) > 0 = prob(Ar,(^) < r), (3) 
which is equal to the sum of the coefficients of ^^, ..., S'^"^ in (2). 
Equation (3) is useful for exact calculation if/? and r are fairly small, 
and the distribution of failure-time is a special Erlangian distribution 
for which G{t, 0 can be computed explicitly. 
We can also obtain from (3) a general asymptotic result for large r. 
For large /, the N^^^ in (1) are independently normally distributed with 
mean r//x and variance a^tlp?. Hence A^,(p) is asymptotically normal 
with mean/7///x and variance/7cr^^//x^. We can now reverse the  
argument of section 3.3 and show that Sy^p) is asymptotically normal with 
mean /xr//? and variance (P'rlp^, 
74 Renewal theory 
6.4. The mean time up to the rth renewal 
It follows from (3.3) that 
S rprob(5,(^) > /) = S rprob(iV,(^) < r) 
r=l r=l 
r = 0 
= j3-^{a/,0}^ (1) 
by (3.2). If we are particularly interested in E{Sr(p)), we can write

EiSr(^p)) = Jprob(5,(^)> t)dt 
0 
and hence ^ ^'^(^rCp)) = fZ^ J f^(^' ^)>''^^- (2) 
''=^ 0 
As an example, suppose that the distribution is special Erlangian 
with two stages and, for simplicity, with p = 1. Then

In particular, where /? = 2, we have that 
^(*^r(2)) = r+h 
If /x is the mean failure-time, equal to 2 when p = 1, the general result 
for this type of distribution is 
E{Sr^2)) = i¥+\)y^^ (4) 
Now it was shown in section 3 that the asymptotic mean of 5'^(p) is 
r/x//7. We can obtain an improved approximation as follows. Consider 
the system at the instant S^^py The total time for which all  
components have then been in use is pSy^py But /?-1 of the components 
have still not failed. If we allowed them to continue until failure, we 
would then have obtained the full' lives' of r+/? — 1 components, this 
total time having approximately an expectation (r+z?- l)/x. Thus 
pEiSri,p)) = (r+/7-l)/x- 
(/?— 1) X expected forward recurrence-time, (5) 
where the forward recurrence-time is that of one of the components 
not forming the rth failure. If rip is not small, it is reasonable to 
approximate by the expected limiting recurrence-time i(/x^+cr^)//x. 
Thus 
r/x,(p-l)(/x^-<7^) 
= — + (6) 
P 2/7/x 
This is exact for the Poisson process, with />t = cr, and, rather  
remarkably, is exact also for the situation leading to (4), the special 
Erlangian distribution with two stages, and with p = 2. For then 
6.5. The interval between successive renewals 
It may sometimes be required to calculate the p.d.f. g{x), say, of the 
interval between successive renewals in the pooled output. Note, 
however, that the pooled output is not, in general, a renewal process 
76 
Renewal theory 
and hence is not completely characterized by g(x). We shall consider 
the limiting distribution for intervals remote from the time origin, or, 
equivalently, take the component processes to be equilibrium 
renewal processes. The mean interval between successive renewals 
is easily seen to be fi/p. To calculate g(x), first consider the limiting 
backward recurrence-time in the pooled output. If this is denoted by 
U, then 
where C// refers to the zth component renewal process. Since the  
component processes are independent,

Now, as noted in section 5.4, the formula relating the limiting p.d.f. 
of recurrence-time to the survivor curve of failure-time applies to 
much more general processes than renewal processes. In particular, 
it applies to the pooled output. Therefore, since the mean interval 
between successive renewals is /x/p, we have that

The superposition of renewal processes 11 
For example if/(x) = p e~ ^""j (3) gives g(x) = ppe~^p"", a result that 
follows also because the pooled output is a Poisson process of rate pp. 
As another example, suppose that the distribution of failure-time is 
rectangular over (0,2/x), the mean failure-time being /x. Then 
^(^> = ^0-jr" (0<x<2,). (4) 
As /? -^ 00, this tends quite rapidly to the exponential distribution of 
mean pifi. We shall see in the next section that the limiting form is 
exponential in general. 
6.6. A large number of component processes 
Probably the most interesting properties of the pooled output refer 
to the 'local' behaviour where/? is large, i.e. to behaviour over time 
periods short compared with individual failure-times. The general 
limiting result is that the local properties are those of a Poisson  
process. We shall illustrate this for a few specific properties. Consider 
first the limiting form of (5.2). 
Denote by Yp an interval between successive events in the pooled 
output, and take as a standardized variable Yp/E(Yp) = p Yp/fju = Zp, 
say. Then the survivor function for Zp is, from (5.2) 
P-i 
-(7)-J^M . 
The limit of this as p-^ oo with x and /x fixed is e~^, since ^(m) is 
continuous as m ->0 + and .^(0) = 1. A similar argument can be used 
to show that, asymptotically, adjacent intervals in the pooled output 
are independently exponentially distributed. 
Some results assessing the rapidity of approach to the limit are 
given as exercises. 
78 Renewal theory 
Consider next the distribution of the number of renewals in a time 
period t = vfju/p, as /? -> oo with v and /x fixed. We suppose that the 
component processes are equilibrium renewal processes and make the 
very mild restriction on failure-time that as x->0 
Fix) = 0{xP) 
for some j8(0 < j8 :^ 1). Then in a single ordinary renewal process 
G,(r,D = l + 0(r^), 
since the probability of one or more renewals in (0,0 is 0(r). Now 
the generating function of the number of renewals in an equilibrium 
renewal process is, by (3.2.8), 
Geia)= 1 + ^ f GMOdu 
0 
= l^^.^z}}^0{t'^P). (2) 
Thus, with t = vfji/p, the generating function in the pooled output 
is the/7th power of (2), namely 
(-■^-C-.))' 
- exp{K^-l)}, 
the generating function of the Poisson distribution of mean v = pt/fi. 
Khintchine (1960, Chapter 5) has proved that in the limit the 
numbers of renewals in non-overlapping intervals follow independent 
Poisson distributions, thus showing that in the limit the pooled output 
is a Poisson process. His proof does not require the component  
process to have identical distributions of failure-time. 
There are two consequences of these results. One is an explanation 
of the occurrence in practice of processes closely approximating to 
Poisson processes. For example, the sequence of calls received at a 
The superposition of renewal processes 79 
large telephone exchange is the pooled output of the individual 
sequences arising from single subscribers. Hence the overall sequence 
can be expected to be locally a Poisson process more or less  
independently of the form of the individual sequences. Secondly, suppose 
that we have for statistical analysis a sequence of renewals that is a 
pooled output of independent processes. The analysis of local 
behaviour, in particular of the intervals between successive renewals, 
will give little or no information about the form of the individual 
processes. 
CHAPTER 7 
Alternating Renewal Processes 
7.1. Introduction 
Suppose that there are two types of component with failure-times 
respectively {X{, X2, ...} and {X^, X'i, ...}. Let the corresponding 
p.d.f.'s be fiix) and /2(jc) and assume that all failure-times are 
statistically independent. Consider a process starting with a new 
Type I component, any component being replaced on failure by a 
component of the opposite type (Fig. 7.1). The resulting process is 
called an alternating renewal process. 
-X 0-

Example. Suppose that a machine is subject to stoppages and call 
the time necessary to restart a stopped machine a repair-time. There 
is thus an alternating sequence of running-times and repair-times. If 
it can be assumed that these are two sequences of independent random 
variables, each sequence having its characteristic p.d.f., we have an 
alternating renewal process. 
Example. It may sometimes be required to compare the mean 
failure-times fti, />t2 of alternative types of component under  
conditions of routine use, without keeping detailed records of failure-times. 
Goodman (1953) suggested that this can be done, provided that a 
reasonable number of components are in use simultaneously, by 
replacing each component on failure by a component of the opposite 
type. It is intuitively clear that after some time the proportion of 
Type I components in use will estimate p^il{p^i-\- i^i)', the proof of this 
and the discussion of the length of time that should elapse before the 
80 
Alternating renewal processes 81 
proportion is determined require the theory of an alternating renewal 
process. 
Example. The following probability problem arises (Owen, 1949) 
in connexion with an idealized model of the phenomenon of crossing- 
over in genetics. We have two parallel lines A, B of length t (Fig. 7.2) 
representing two chromosomes. Cross-over points Q, C2, ... are 
distributed in accordance with an ordinary renewal process starting 
at the origin, the centromere. At the first cross-over point Ci, the A 
and B lines cross over. At the second, they cross back again, and so on. 
The question of interest is whether at a point t from the origin the 
lines A and B are in their original position; in other words, we want 
the probability that in an ordinary renewal process there are an even

number of renewals in (0, t). This is conveniently dealt with by  
considering an alternating renewal process in which both types of  
component have the same p.d.f. of failure-time. We then calculate the 
probability that a Type I component is in use at time t. 
Example. We have in section 2.4 taken as an example of an ordinary 
renewal process a counter problem in which a renewal occurs  
whenever a particle is recorded. The failure-time between renewals is the 
sum of a time in which the counter is blocked and a time,  
exponentially distributed, in which the counter is open but no particle 
arrives. Since these two times are independent the system could be 
treated as an alternating renewal process. 
The idea of an alternating renewal process can be generalized. For 
example, we may have k types of component following one another 
in cyclic order. Another generalization is to have k types of  
component and a matrix ((/?//)) of transition probabilities, 7?/,- specifying 
the probability that a Type / component is replaced on failure by a 
Type j component. Such a system is called a semi-Markov process. 
82 Renewal theory 
7.2. The renewal functions 
Several properties of the alternating renewal process can be obtained 
directly from the theory of the ordinary or modified renewal process. 
For example, consider the sequence formed by the failures of Type II 
components. This is an ordinary renewal process in which each 
failure-time is the sum of the associated Type I and Type II failure- 
times. Thus the first Type 11 failure occurs at time (X{-\-Xl), the 
second at time (X{-\- Xl)-^(X2+ X2), and so on. We can therefore 
apply the previous results, taking as the distribution of failure-time 
the convolution of/i(x) and/2(x), with Laplace transform/f (5)/2 (5). 
By (4.1.4), the mean number of Type II failures in (0,0, -^2(0, say, 
satisfies 
and in particular the asymptotic results of section 4.2 can be applied. 
Similarly, if we are concerned solely with Type I failures, we have 
a modified renewal process, in which the p.d.f. of first failure-time is 
/i(x), and of all subsequent failure-times is the convolution of/i(x) 
and/2(x). Hence, by (4.1.7), the expected number of Type I failures 
in (0,0 has Laplace transform 
^'^'^ = .{!-/*(.)/!(.)}• ^^^ 
The corresponding renewal densities have Laplace transforms 
hr(s) = sHr(s) (/= 1,2). (3) 
7.3. The type of component in use at time t 
An important property that cannot be obtained from the earlier 
theory is the probability, 7ri(0 say, that a Type I component is in use 
at time t. This is the sum of the probabilities that 
(a) the initial component has a failure-time greater than t; 
(b) there is a Type II failure in (u,u + 8u), for some « < r, and the 
Type I component then introduced has a failure-time greater than 
A Iternating renewal processes 83 
Therefore

On taking Laplace transforms, we have that 
and, since h%s) = 5jyf (5), we have from (2.1) that 
'''^^> = .{i-/r(.)/!(.)}' ^'^ 
Note that 
7rf(5) = jyj(5)-jyf(5)+l/5, 
from which 
7ri(0 = ^2(0-^1(0+1. (3) 
A direct probabilistic proof of (3) is easy and leads to an alternative 
derivation of (2). 
Exact inversion of (2) is possible in the usual cases. For example, 
suppose that both failure-time distributions are exponential, with 
parameters pi and P2- We may call the resulting process an alternating 
Poisson process. Then 
5(j+pi + p2) 
P2 1^ Pi 1

Thus

Since the mean failure-times are /x/ = 1/pi, we can write (5) as

Now for any distributions of failure-time, the system will, after a 
very large number 2m of failures, have spent a proportion of time 
W + '-' + ^C) ^Mi H-i 
with a Type I component in use. 
It is therefore highly plausible, and can be proved by the strong law 
of large numbers, that (6) holds independently of the form of the 
distributions of failure-time. This is proved formally from (2) by 
letting 5^0. Since 
/?(5)= l-SfJLi-^ois) (/= 1,2), 
we have that 
.*(,) = _^J+.(l), 
M1 + M2 s \s/ 
from which (6) follows. 
To investigate the approach to the limit for general Erlangian 
distributions, we consider, as in previous similar investigations, the 
non-zero root or roots of the equation 
/l*(5)/2*(5) = 1 (7) 
with largest real part. If there is a single such root, 5i, a simple root, 
we obtain in 7ri(r) a term proportional to e*'', a multiple root giving 
a term t^e^^ ^ Two simple complex conjugate roots produce a damped 
oscillatory approach to the limit (6). 
A special case of (2) deals with the genetical problem mentioned in 
section 1. Here both distributions of failure-time are the same and 
(2) becomes 
5{1 +/*(5)} 
and the special case (4) reduces to 
^i(0 = 4+4^-'^^ (9) 
A Iternating renewal processes 85 
7.4. Equilibrium alternating renewal processes 
In some applications, it will be required to consider equilibrium 
alternating renewal processes. There are three possibilities: 
{a) We may take the time origin a long way from the start of the 
process, but be given that a Type 1 component is in use. Then we take 
the first failure-time as having the p.d.f. «^i(x)//>ti, the second as being 
a Type 11 component with p.d.f. of failure-time/2(jc), etc.; 
(Z>) We may be given that a Type II component is in use at the time 
origin, the roles of Type I and 11 components in {a) being interchanged; 
(c) We may consider an equilibrium process in which the type of 
component in use at the time origin is not given. This amounts to 
taking a mixture of {a) and (Z>) with probabilities />ti/(/>ti +112) and 
^2/(^1 + ^2)- 
Suppose that we require the equilibrium probability, given that a 
Type I component is in use at the time origin, that a Type I  
component is also in use t later. Denote this by TrJ^^r). The analogue of 
(3.1) is

To invert, (9) is expressed in partial fractions. 
7.5. The precision of systematic sampling 
As an application of the formulae of section 4, consider the estimation 
by systematic sampling of the proportion of time for which a Type I 
component is in use. Take n sampling points, J apart, the first a long 
A Iternating renewal processes 87 
time from the start of the process, so that equiUbrium theory is 
applicable. For the zth sampling point define 
1 if a Type I component is in use, 
' 0 if a Type II component is in use. 
and let 
Z=-S^/ (2) 
n 
be the estimate of the probability that a Type I component is in use, 
or, equivalently, of fjLil(fjLi + fjL2). 
Example. Consider one or more machines, each of which is, at any 
instant, either running or stopped. A widely-used method for  
estimating the proportion of time machines are running is to observe 
machines at isolated time points, to record as' running' or' stopped', 
with an obvious generalization if there are more than two states, and 
to estimate by the proportion of sampling points that are 'running'. 
It is important that the sampling points are fixed by a method not 
subject to observer biases. Sometimes randomization is necessary to 
avoid trouble from possible periodicities, but in many applications 
systematic sampling of each machine, i.e. observation at exactly equal 
time intervals, J, will be appropriate. The question then arises of how 
the precision of the resulting estimate depends on J. If we assume that 
the 'running' and 'stopped' intervals on each machine define an 
alternating renewal process, the following theory shows how the 
variance of the estimate depends on A. The assumption that any one 
machine defines an alternating renewal process, while reasonable for 
the present purpose, will usually lead to an underestimate of the true 
variance of the estimate, because of the neglect of long-term changes 
in raw material, etc.

(M1 + M2) 
88 Renewal theory 
To calculate var(Z) we need also the covariance of Z/ and Zj. The 
sequence {Z/} is stationary and cov (Zi,Z/+^) depends only on k. In 
fact 
cov(Zi,Z;+^) = E(Z,Zi^k)-E{Zi)E{Zi^k)

var(Z) = /'^\2 + -27-^-^ S («-A:)m(A:J). (6) 
We first consider the limit of (6) for fixed J as «-> 00. The leading 
term in (6) is the binomial variance corresponding to n independent 
observations with variance (4). For large n and for functions m(0 that 
decay to zero rapidly, e.g. exponentially, we can neglect the second 
term in the summation and write 
var(Z) ^ ^1/^2 2 J ^^^^^ ^^^ 
«(M1 + M2) «(M1 + M2)^ = 1

Thus, substituting in (7), we have that

To evaluate (7) for general Erlangian distributions of failure-time, 
note that each term Ae^^^ in m(0 leads to a term^^*^^/(l -^*i^) in 
The formula (9) is the most useful one either if the scale of effort 
available fixes r and we want to compare different spacings J, or if J 
is fairly large so that the binomial variance is expected to be a good 
approximation. The term (1 + y)/(l - y) in (9) gives the factor by 
which the binomial variance is increased; for example with 
J = jLtj = ii2, the factor (1 + y)/(l - y) for the alternating Poisson 
process is equal to 1.31. 
Another limiting form for the variance is obtained as J ->0, the 
total time of observation t^ being fixed, nA = tQ. The limiting variance 
corresponds to continuous observation of the process, i.e. to  
measurement of individual failure-times, and to the use of the sample mean 
failure-times as estimates of/xj and />t2-

CHAPTER 8 
Cumulative Processes 
8.1. Introduction 
In the previous chapters there has been associated with the /th  
component one random variable, Xi, the failure-time. We think of failure 
as a point event occurring after time Xi. Suppose now that a second 
variable Wi is associated with the failure of the /th component, Wi 
and Xi possibly being dependent. It is assumed that {Wi) are  
independent and identically distributed and that IVi is independent of Xj 
(j ^ i). Consider the random variable Z, defined at time t by 
Nt 
S Wi iN,= 1,2,...), 
Z, = -1 (1) 
0 {N, = 0). 
That is, the IVf are summed for all components that have failed at or 
before t. The stochastic process of values {ZJ is called a cumulative 
process (see Fig. 8.1). 
Example. If the Wi are identically equal to one, Z, = A^,, the number 
of renewals up to t. 
Example. Consider an industrial replacement problem and let Wi 
be the cost of replacement for the /th failure. Then Z, is the total cost 
of replacements up to time t. 
Example. Suppose that the input into a queueing or storage process 
is formed as follows. There is a series of arrival instants forming a 
Poisson process, or more generally a renewal process. The number of 
customers, or amount of material, arriving at the /th arrival instant 
is Wi. The random variable Z, is then the number of customers, or 
amount of material, to have arrived by time t. We often take Wi to 
be independent of Xi. 
Example. Consider a component subject to wear produced by a 
series of blows. Let the blows occur in a Poisson process, or more 
91 
92 
Renewal theory 
generally in a renewal process, and let Wi be the amount of wear  
produced by the /th blow. Then Z^ is the total wear of the component at 
time /. 
The general concept of a cumulative process and the asymptotic 
results to be sketched below are due to Smith (1955, 1958). His 
definition is, however, more general in that the process {ZJ is not

required to change only at renewal instants. Provided that (1) holds 
when f is a renewal instant, and some regularity conditions are 
satisfied, the process is a cumulative process. 
Example, Consider the renewal process formed from failures of 
Type II components in an alternating renewal process. The /th 
failure-time is then XI+X'\, the sum of the corresponding Type I and 
Type II failure-times. Let Wt = Xf. Then Z^ is the sum of all Type II 
failure-times up to time /, excluding the failure-time of a Type II com-

ponent in use at /. Thus if Type I and Type II components represent 
'running' and 'stopped' times of a machine, Zf is, for large /, nearly 
the same as the total stopped time up to /, Z/ say. According to 
Smith's more general definition, Z/ itself is a cumulative process; the 
asymptotic properties of Z^ and Z/ are the same. 
In these examples Wi > 0. This is, however, not in general assumed 
in the following sections. 
8.2. Independent increments 
Suppose that Wi is independent of A^-, so that the two sequences {Wi) 
and {Xi) are mutually independent. The distribution of Wi may be 
continuous or discrete; in either case we write 
*g(p) = Eie-P"^) (1) 
for the moment generating function, which is, of course, the Laplace 
transform of the p.d.f. when the distribution is continuous. When the 
distribution is discrete, it will usually be simpler to work with the 
probability generating function, EiX^), but this can always be 
recovered by writing/? = — log^ in *g(/?). 
Similarly, write *l(p;t) for the moment generating function of Z^. 
The function *l*(p;s) will be the Laplace transform with respect to t, 
i.e. 
00 
j e-''E(e-P^')dt. (2) 
The conditional distribution of Z^, given Nf = /*, is the r-fold  
convolution of the distribution of Wi. Hence 
E(e-P^^\Z, = r) = {*g(p)V, (3) 
and, therefore, 
*l(p;t) = E(e-P^^) = £ {*g(p)YpT0b(N, = r). (4) 
r=0 
94 Renewal theory 
Now this sum is just the probability generating function of A^^, with 
argument *g(j?). The Laplace transform of this with respect to t is 
given for the ordinary renewal process in (3.2.4), from which 
^^' ^ 5{l-*g(/7)/*(^)} ^^ 
This, while an attractive general formula, is unlikely to lead to 
explicit answers except to rather simple problems. 
The Laplace transforms of the moments of Z^ can be found by 
expanding in powers of/?. Alternatively, we may argue in terms of the 
elementary properties of conditional expectations and variances, as 
follows. 
Since, if ft^ and a^ are the mean and variance of W, 
E(Zt \Nt = r) = rfx^, \SiT(Zt \ Nf = r) = ral, (6) 
we have that 
E(Z,) = E{Nt)iJ^^ = H{i)ix^, (7) 
var(Z,) = H{t)al-\-y2iv{Nt)ixl (8) 
cov(Z„iV,) = y2ir{Nt)ix^. (9) 
The mean and variance of A^^ have been studied in Chapter 4. 
Further, for given large r, Z^ is nearly normal with mean and 
variance (6). Hence its moment generating function is nearly 
QXi^i-rix^p + lralp^). (10) 
The unconditional moment generating function is the expectation of 
(10) with respect to the distribution of A^^, which itself is nearly 
normal with mean tl^ix and variance tallfxl. For clarity, we write fju^ 
and al for the mean and variance of failure-time, previously denoted 
by fx and o-^. The expectation of (10) with respect to the asymptotic 
distribution is 
Cumulative processes 95 
If we convert this into a moment generating function for the  
standardized variable 
2n-2Al/2' 
XH'x H-l J 
(11) 
we get, as/->oo, 
Thus Zj is asymptotically normal with mean and variance 
fx^t/fx^ and oltlix^+iilaltlixl. (12) 
The expressions (12) are, of course, obtained directly from (7) and (8) 
on replacing H(t) and var(A^y) by their asymptotic values. 
The same type of argument shows that the limiting distribution of 
(NtyZt) is bivariate normal with correlation coefficient, derived from 
(7)-(9), 
W2' (13) 
(-i 
where yy^, = ctwIi^w and y^ = ajfju^^ are the coefficients of variation 
of W and X. 
8.3. The cumulative process associated with a Poisson process 
The most important special cases of the results of section 2 arise when 
the renewal process is a Poisson process, of rate />, say. Then the 
moment generating function of Zf is 
*l(p,t) = E(e-P^^) 
=2 
(•*«'<f^'-" 
r\ 
0 
= QXp{pt*g(p)''ptl (1) 
When the distribution of Wis discrete there is an exactly  
corresponding equation for the probability generating function of Z^, the function 
*g(p) in (1) being replaced by the probability generating function of 
96 Renewal theory 
W, The semi-invariant generating function of A^^ is the log of (1) and 
the rth semi-invariant, being the coefficient of (-pY/rl, is pt times 
the rth moment about the origin of W. 
The following are among special cases of possible interest in 
applications. 
(i) Two-point distribution for W. Suppose that prob(^F= 1) = ^, 
prob(^=2)= 1-^. Then the probability generating function for 
Z^is 
exp{p/^^ + Ml-^)^'-/>0, (2) 
from which the distribution of Z^ is easily found. 
(ii) Geometric distribution for W, Suppose that the probability 
generating function of ^F is (1 - 6)t,l{\ - 60- Then the probability 
generating function of Z^ is 
(iii) Exponential distribution for W. This is sometimes a plausible 
model for the wear process mentioned in section 1. If the rate  
parameter is A, the moment generating function for Z^ is, from (1), 
,-P'exp(^V (4) 
To invert (4), considered as a Laplace transform in /?, we write it in 
the form 
e-P'+e-P'LJf!h\-A. (5) 
The first term in (5) corresponds to a discrete probability e ^^ at 
Zt = 0, and the second term to a p.d.f. 
JI^]e-P'-^''Ii{2V(ptXx)}, (6) 
where /„(v) denotes a Bessel function of imaginary argument. 
Similar results hold when the steps IV have a special Erlangian 
distribution. 
Cumulative processes 97 
8.4. The first passage time 
In some applications, for example that of section 10.4, we are interested 
not directly in the distribution of Z^ for fixed / but rather in the time, 
Tb, say, taken for the process {ZJ to reach or cross a barrier at z = Z>, 
the so-called first passage time. General methods for investigating 
first passage times have been much discussed in the theory of  
stochastic processes (Kemperman, 1961). Here, however, we shall deal 
only with the relatively trivial situation where all the increments W 
are positive. It is then impossible for the process {ZJ to recross 
the barrier and therefore 
Th > nfandonlyifZ^ < b. (1) 
This is a generalization of the relation (3.1.1) which was  
fundamental to the discussion of A^^ for renewal processes. Indeed, if all 
increments W are identically one, Z^ = A^^ and T^ = Sb, the time up 
to the bth renewal, for integral b. In this special case, the properties 
of Th can be obtained directly and we use (1) to investigate Z^. Now, 
as also in section 6.3, we argue in the other direction, from Z^ to T^. 
For simplicity, suppose that the distribution of W is continuous. 
If q(x;b) denotes the p.d.f. of T^ and, as in section 3, l(x;t) the p.d.f. 
ofZ^,then,by(l), 
00 b 
J q(x;b)dx= { l(x; t)dx. (2) 
t 0 
We use again the notation of section 3, namely that 
*qip;b) = Eie-P""^), *l(p;t) = Eie'^^^ 
00 00 
*q*(p;s) = J *q(p;b)e-''db, V*(p',s) = J V(p',t)e-''dt. 
0 0 
Then an application to (2) of a Laplace transformation with respect 
to / shows that 
b 
i-V/^;^) 
= j l*(x;p)dx, 
0 
b 
i.e. that *q(p;b) = \-p \ l*(x;p)dx. 
98 Renewal theory 
A further Laplace transformation, this time with respect to b, leads to 
*q*(p;s) = --^-*l*(s;p). (3) 
s s 
Equation (2.5) gives *l*(j?;s) and we therefore have that 
"^-'^ s{\-*g{s)f*ip)} ^^^ 
In (4) the variable/? is the argument of the moment generating  
function of Th, whereas s is the argument of the Laplace transform with 
respect to b, the position of the barrier. 
First, if we extract the coefficient of (—pYlr! in the expansion of (4) 
in powers of/?, we get the Laplace transform with respect to b of the 
rth moment EiT^). Thus, in particular, 
s s{l-*g(s)} s{l-*g(s)Y 
The inversion problems are those arising in connexion with a renewal 
process with distribution of failure-time g(x), and exact results are 
available, for example when the distribution g(x) is of the special 
Erlangian type. If H^^\t) is the renewal function in an ordinary 
process with distribution of failure-time g(x), then 
E(T,) = fM,{\+H^/\b)}, (7) 
A special case when the inversion of (4) is fairly simple is when the 
p.d.f.'s /(jc) and g(x) are exponential with rates p and A. Then

Hence

Of course (10) and (12) can be obtained fairly easily from first  
principles without using the general formula (4). 
8.5. A general limiting result 
We now examine in outline the properties of Zf in a more general 
situation in which corresponding W and X are correlated, dealing 
only with the limiting result for large /. The argument is simplest when 
W has linear regression on X with constant variance about the 
regression line, i.e. when 
E(W\ Z = X) = fj,^+p^^^(x-t.,) (1) 
wsiT(W\X=x) = <T^(l-pl,X (2) 
where p^^^x is the correlation coefficient between W and X. 
Let Xi,,,., XrbQ, for large r, a sequence of failure-times leading 
to Nf = r. Thus Xi +...^X^^^ t. The values of r of interest are those 
within OWt) of tip.. Then 
E(Zt I ^1,..., Xr) -- rp.^+Py,x—it-rp.^ (3) 
var (Z, I Zi,..., Z,) = ral{\ - pi,), (4) 
Now average over all Zi,..., Z^. that lead to Zi +... + Z,. '^ /. Then 
E{Zt \Nt = r) '^ rfXy, + py,^ — (/ - rp.^ (5) 
var(Z, I TV, = r) = rcr^d -p^^). (6) 
100 Renewal theory 
Finally, taking expectations with respect to Nf, and using 
E(Nt) '^ t/fjL^, wax(Nt) '^ torl/fJi'l, we have that 
E(Zt) - tfMjfM^, (7) 
var(Z,) = EN,w3iT(Z,\N,) + w3iTN,{E(ZAN,)}

The argument of section 2 can be used to make it plausible that the 
limiting distribution is bivariate normal, and this is indeed so. 
The formulae (7)-(10) hold witliout the assumptions (1) and (2) of 
linear regression of ^For X, the quantity p^x still being defined as the 
correlation coefficient between W and X. To deal with the more 
general situation, we replace (1) by the least-squares regression line 
of ^Fon Z (Cramer, 1946, p. 272), writing 
E{W\ X=x) = tM^+Py,^—(x-'fMx) + rjx, (11)

Cumulative processes 101 
where rj^^ is the deviation from the regression line at x and 
E(r)^) = E(Xrj^) = 0, E(rj\+al,x)^<^^(l-pl.l (13) 
The last quantity is the mean square deviation from regression. 
The difficulty in repeating the argument lies in assessing the  
contributions of rjx to (5) and calculating the variance (6). We shall not go 
into details. The results and rigorous argument are due to Smith 
(1955). 
As an illustration, consider the last example of section 1, in which 
Zf is nearly the total time up to / for which Type II components are 
in use, A^^ being the number of Type II renewals. Since 
X,= X;+X[, Wi=Xt, (14) 
we have that 
^x= 0-1 + CT2> Pxw = 0^2/(0-l + CT2) ' , Gy^,= (72.

For the alternating Poisson process, 
var(Z,) --^^^^3, corr(Z„iV,)-0. (18)

Thus, the number of Type II renewals and the total time for which a 
Type II component is in use are asymptotically independent. 
CHAPTER 9 
Some other Generalizations 
9.1. Introduction 
In Chapters 2-5 we studied very simple processes involving just a 
single sequence of renewals. In Chapters 6-8 essentially the same 
methods were applied to more complicated systems, not confined to 
a single series of renewals. 
In the models of Chapters 2-5, the key assumptions are that 
A: all failure-times, except perhaps the first, have the same 
distribution; 
B: all failure-times are independent; 
C: all failure-times are positive. 
In the next few sections we consider the extent to which the results 
and methods of renewal theory, especially those concerning the 
number of renewals, A^^, require the full force of A, B and C. For 
simplicity we continue to deal only with failure-times having a  
continuous distribution, although nearly all the discussion applies with 
only minor change if the distribution is discrete. We shall outline 
various generalizations, especially of the asymptotic theorems of 
renewal theory. Full details will not be given, because it is not clear 
which, if any, of the generalizations are likely to be sufficiently useful 
to warrant thorough study. 
9.2. Some results based on the laws of large numbers 
The result of section 4.2 that 
H(t) = E(N,) - ///x (1) 
is an almost direct consequence of the physical interpretation of the 
mean failure-time, /x, as a long-run average, combined with  
assumption C of section 1. For if r is any very large number 
IX (2) 
[102] 
Some other generalizations 103 
and this, combined with the relation between Xi + ... + Xj. and A^^, 
establishes (1). The mathematical theorem necessary to make this 
argument rigorous is the strong law of large numbers, which puts (2) 
precisely. 
Now equation (2) requires much less than the full assumptions A 
and B and hence we may expect (1) to hold very generally for positive 
failure-times, for example when: 
{a) all failure-times are independent, have the same mean /a, but 
different distributions, the dispersions of these distributions 
being such that (2) still holds; 
{b) the failure-times are correlated, but on the average sufficiently 
weakly for (2) still to hold, for example, for the variance of the 
left-hand side to tend to zero; 
(c) the failure-times have different means fj^i, fJL2, -", but 
z ^^• 
In general, assumptions A and B can be relaxed to a great extent and 
(1) will still hold. In most of these cases the limiting renewal density 
will be 1//X. 
Very similar remarks apply to the result of section 7.3 that in an 
alternating renewal process the probability that a Type I component 
is in use a long way from the time origin tends to 
9.3. Some limiting results based on the relation between Nt and Sr 
A more useful limiting result than (2.1) is the asymptotic normality of 
A^^ with mean ///^ and variance a^t/fx^ (section 3.3.). For this we need 
assumption C, plus the asymptotic normality of Sr, 
Sr= X, + ,,, + Xr (1) 
with mean r/^ and variance /-ct^. 
104 Renewal theory 
Now conditions for the asymptotic normality of sums of  
independent but not identically distributed random variables are well 
known (Loeve, 1960, section 21). If we add to these conditions the 
requirement that 
E(Xi) + ... + E(Xr) - rfjL, var(X0 + ... + var(X,) - ra\ (2) 
the required result about A^^ will follow. 
If we have correlated failure-times, the asymptotic normality of S^ 
will follow under fairly weak assumptions. We require also that 
E(Xi) + ... + E(X,)^rfM, 
wsLTiS,) = S var(^,) + 2 S cow (Xi,Xj) - ro-l (3) 
1=1 i>j 
The quantity a^ is no longer directly related to the variance of an 
individual failure-time. Some special cases are given as exercises. 
9.4. Some exact results 
We have seen in sections 2 and 3 that limiting results about A^^ can be 
obtained under much weaker assumptions than A, B. However, to 
obtain exact results about A^^ it will nearly always be necessary to find 
some explicit properties of Zi +... + ^^ for every r, for example an 
expression for the p.d.f. or for the Laplace transform. The formulae 
of section 3.1 can then be used. Situations where explicit calculation 
is possible are likely to be very special. The following are three 
examples. 
First, there may be a small number of different types of component 
occurring in a simple order, for example cyclic order. This is a direct 
generalization of the alternating renewal process studied in Chapter 7. 
Secondly, suppose that the failure-times are independent and that 
the p.d.f. for the /th component is of the special Erlangian type with 
Ui stages, and with rate parameter p, the same for all components. 
Then Sr has the same type of distribution, with ai + ... + a^ stages. 
Hence, exact properties of A^^ can be found, especially if the partial 
sums of the sequence {ai} have simple explicit expressions. This seems 
a very artificial situation. 
Some other generalizations 105 
Finally, certain situations involving correlated failure-times can be 
dealt with by the use of Erlangian distributions. For example, let Xi 
and X2 be two failure-times of the form 
^1 = Zi + ...+Z^_^+i+ ...+Z^, (1) 
X2 = Za-b-\-l+ , . .+Za+Za-^i + . . .+Z2a-by © 
where the Z^ are independently exponentially distributed with  
parameter p. Then Xi and X2 have identical special Erlangian  
distributions with a stages and the correlation coefficient between Xi and X2 
is b/a. Further 
Xi + X2 = {Z^+...+Z^_b + Za+l + ...+Z2a-b} 
+ 2{Z^_6+i + ...+ZJ (3) 
and hence has Laplace transform 
Suppose now that b < Ja, that any two adjacent failure-times have 
correlation coefficient b/a and that any two non-adjacent failure- 
times are independent. Then, again for special Erlangian distributions, 
we have a representation extending (1) and (2). The last b Z's for Xi 
are the first b Z's for ^/+1, and so on. Then Sr is easily seen to be the 
sum of ra — 2rb + 2b Z's, each with coefficient one, and rb — b Z's, each 
with coefficient two. 
Hence the p.d.f. of Sf. has Laplace transform 
[p + sj 
ra-2rb + 2b / \r£>—6 
t 
p+^i ■ *" 
Consider the renewal function, Ho(t), in the analogue of an ordinary 
renewal process. Then, by the argument of section 4.1, sH^(s) is equal 
to the sum of (5) from r = 1 to oo. Hence 
irt) P"^-^^^'' (6) 
106 Renewal theory 
As a deduction from (6), consider the limiting form of Ho(t) as 
r ^ 00, for which we expand (6) as 5->0. We get that 
as^ as las 
whence Ho{t) = ^/+(--^) + t7(l), 
a \a 2a } 
(7) 
as / -> 00. Now the mean and variance of failure-time are /x = a/p and 
o-^ = a/p^. Thus (7) can be written 
pL \a 2pL 
?-!«( 
Hoit) = ~+\z + -:^\ + o{\). (8) 
This is to be compared with the result (4.2.3) for arbitrary independent 
failure-times 
2 2 
^o(0 = -+Vr- + ^(l). (9) 
p. 2p, 
The additional term b/a in (8) is the correlation coefficient between 
adjacent failure-times. 
The reason that the additional term in (8) is positive is that positive 
correlation between the failure-times increases the variance of the Sr 
and thus has a similar effect to increasing a^ in (9). 
9.5. Failure-times which may be negative 
In all the previous discussion, the failure-times have been assumed 
positive. In terms of the original applications with the failure of  
components, it makes no sense to have negative failure-times. However, 
some of the formal mathematical problems of renewal theory remain 
when the random variables in the defining sequence {Xf} can take 
negative values. 
Let {Xi, X2y ...} be independent identically distributed random 
variables with positive mean p,. If the Xi may be negative we can no 
longer interpret them as times and we therefore think of the process 
differently, as follows. At time r = 0, a particle starts at the origin. 
The particle moves in discrete jumps along the real axis as follows. 
Some other generalizations 107 
At time t = 1, it moves to Xi. At time t = 2 it jumps a distance X2, 
its position now being defined by 52 = ^1 + ^2- At time r = r its 
position i^Sr= Xi + ... + Xr. We now have a simple random walk in 
one dimension in discrete time. The ordinary renewal process of 
Chapter 2 is the special case where all the steps in the random walk 
are in the same direction. 
The quantity Sr previously studied as the time to the rth renewal is 
now the position of the particle after r steps, and is easily studied. The 
quantity previously denoted by Nt, the number of renewals in (0, /), 
now has two possible generalizations; 
{a) the number of steps in the random walk falling in the interval 
(0,/); 
or {b) Nf+l can be defined as the number of steps in the random 
walk necessary to first reach or cross a barrier at t. 
The simple relation of section 3.1 no longer relates Nf and Sr because 
it is possible for the particle to leave the interval (0,/) and later to 
return. Methods for studying the first passage time (b) have been 
widely studied (Bartlett, 1955, p. 48; Kemperman, 1961) and will not 
be considered here. As for (a), we simply note that some of general 
mathematical theorems of renewal theory can be extended to cover 
this. For example it can be shown that the number of steps in the walk 
falling in the interval {t,t+h) is asymptotically /f//x as r-> 00. 
CHAPTER 10 
Probabilistic Models of Failure 
10.1. Introduction 
It has been stressed in the earlier chapters both that the general 
theorems and formulae of renewal theory apply to arbitrary  
distributions of failure-time and that 'failure' can be given a very wide 
range of physical interpretations. We now turn to problems  
specifically connected with failure in the sense of breakdown. 
We calculate in the present chapter the distribution of failure-time 
that would arise were the failure process described by various simple 
probabilistic models. The object of such investigations is 
(i) to give qualitative insight into the types of failure-time  
distribution that would occur under various idealized conditions; 
(ii) to be able to fit an appropriate distribution to observed  
distributions of failure-time and to interpret the parameters in terms of 
some underlying physical process. 
The possibility of inferring something about the underlying 
physical mechanism from the observed distribution of failure-time is 
an attractive one. However, there are great difficulties; for example 
major changes in the model may make no, or very slight, changes in 
the distribution of failure-time. The really satisfactory way of finding 
out more about the failure-process is to make subsidiary  
measurements on the components throughout their life and to combine these 
with the value of the failure-time and, where appropriate, the type of 
failure. 
One very simple model of failure can be dealt with immediately. 
Suppose that failure is caused by the occurrence of some single 
external event having nothing to do with the age of the component. 
For example, suppose that failure is caused instantaneously by gross 
misuse of the component. It would then often be reasonable to take 
the probability of failure in a small time interval to be constant and 
independent of the age of the component. Then the age-specific 
108 
Probabilistic models of failure 109 
failure rate is constant and hence the distribution exponential 
(section 1.2). We shall see in the next section that this is by no means 
the only model leading to an exponential distribution of failure time. 
10.2. Failures of many types 
Suppose that there are a large number n of types of failure, with 
failure-times Ti,..., r„. That is, Yi is the notional failure-time that 
would be observed if all types of failure except the /th were suppressed. 
The actual failure-time, denoted by Xn when there are n types of 
failure, is then Min( l^i,..., y„). Now assume that {Yi) are mutually 
independent and identically distributed random variables with 
cumulative distribution function L{y). Then, since 
Xn > Arif andonly if Yi'^ x (/ = 1,2,...,«), (1) 
it follows that 
prob(^„ > X) = probfY/ > x (i = l,2,...,/2)} 
= {l-LWr. (2) 
Suppose now that L(x) '^ ax°^ (a > 0) as x tends to zero. Then, for 
sufficiently large n, only small x need be considered in (2) and 
prob(^„ > x) '^ exp{~«L(x)} 
^ Qxpi-nax^"}. (3) 
Let Xl = XJkn, where k^ is a normalizing constant to be chosen so 
that Xl has a limiting distribution as « -> oo. Then 
prob(^J > x) = prob(^„ > k„x) 
^ Qxpi-nak^x^"}. (4) 
Take k„ = (na) ~ ^^°'. Then 
prob{Xl > x) ^ Qxp{-x""}. (5) 
Thus the standardized variable (nay^°^Xn has a limiting WeibuU 
distribution (section 1.4 (vi)). 
110 Renewal theory 
Note that the index a of the WeibuU distribution is determined by 
the local behaviour near x = 0 of the underlying cumulative  
distribution function L(x). If a = 1, so that L(x) is what we may call locally 
rectangular near x = 0, the limiting distribution is exponential. This 
'explanation' of the occurrence of the exponential distribution is 
quite different from that given in section 1. 
The model of failure discussed in the present section is not often 
likely to be very reasonable as it stands. Even if there are many 
possible types of failure, it would usually be more realistic to treat the 
Yi as not independent and not all having the same distribution. It is 
very plausible, however, that the limiting form (5) will apply under 
much more general conditions than those assumed in the above 
derivation. 
10.3. Two types of faUure 
In the previous section we considered a limiting situation in which 
the number of types of failure is large. Now we consider some  
problems arising when there are a small number of types of failure, say 
for simplicity two, and the nature of each failure is observed. 
Let the notional failure-times for Type I and II failures, defined as 
in section 2, be independent random variables Yiand 1^2 with p.d.f.'s 
li(x) and l2(x) and with age-specific failure rates ^i(jc) and <f>2(x). 
Then the observed failure-time is 
X= MiniYuY^) (1) 
and the observed type of failure is I if Fi < Y2 and II if Yi > Y2. We 
deal only with continuous random variables and therefore it is  
immaterial how the type of failure is defined when Yi = Y2. The  
properties of X and the type of failure can be specified in various ways. 
We shall, in particular, use the following: 
TT^jc), the conditional probability that failure is of Type / given that 
failure occurs at x; 
fi(x), the joint probability - p.d.f. that failure is of Type / and 
occurs at x; 
f(x), the p.d.f. of failure-time; 
TTf, the probability that failure is of Type /. 
Probabilistic models of failure 111 
Then, because of the independence of Yi and Y2, it follows that 
prob{x < ^1=^x4- Ax and Y2 > x) 
fi(x) = hm — 
= /lW^2W, (2) 
and similarly /2W =/iW-^iW, (3) 
where ^/(jc) are the survivor functions corresponding to li(x). It 
follows that the conditional odds that the failure is of Type I rather 
than of Type II, given that failure occurs at x, are 
7Ti(x) ^ h(x)^2(x) 
^2(x) l2{x)^i{x) 
If we use (1.2.8), the fundamental property of age-specific failure 
rates, we have that 
TTiix) <t>i(x) 
'^lix) <f)2(x) 
(5) 
In particular the type of failure is independent of age if and only if 
the age-specific failure-rates are proportional. 
The p.d.f. of failure-time is 
/U)=/iW+/2W (6) 
= ^,(x) ^2M{Ux) + hMh (7) 
and the overall probability that failure is of Type I is 
00 
^1 = jfi(x)dx. (8) 
0 
One special case of these formulae is when the underlying p.d.f.'s 
//(jc) are exponential with parameters />/. Then 
^/ = />//(/>!+P2). 
the p.d.f. of failure-time is exponential with parameter /oi+/)2, and 
failure-time and type of failure are independent. 
112 Renewal theory 
Equations (2)-(8) give the properties of the observed failure-time, 
X, and type of failure in terms of the underlying distributions //(x). 
Conversely, corresponding to a given joint distribution of Zand type 
of failure, there is a unique pair of distributions //(x). 
For the survivor function of A" is 
^{x) = prob{yi > a:and Y2 > x) 
= ^i(x)^2(x). (9) 
Therefore, by (2) and (9), 
fjM ^ Ijjx) 
^(x) ^i(x) 
Hence, by (1.2.11), 
= <^iW. (10) 
Equation (11) corresponds to the life-table analysis of a set of data. 
It would very often be natural to consider a model similar to the 
present one but in which the underlying random variables Yi, Y2 are 
not necessarily independent. A consequence of (11) is that it is not 
possible, from observations on failure-time and type of failure alone, 
to test for the existence of correlation between Yi and Y2. For an 
arbitrary joint distribution, specified by arbitrary functions fi(x), is 
always exactly consistent with independent Yi, Y2. 
A second, quite different, type of model with two types of failure, 
can be obtained by postulating what is in effect a very extreme form 
of dependence between Yi and Y2. Let components be of two types, 
with probabilities tti, 772, where 771 + 772 = 1. Components of Type / 
are certain to have Type / failures, the p.d.f. of failure-time bQing fi(x). 
It is clear that any joint distribution of failure-time and type of failure 
could be produced in this way. 
To illustrate the difference between the two types of model, suppose 
that the conditional distribution of observed failure-time fi(x) are 
exponential distributions, A^^"^^^, and let 77,-, be the probability of 
Probabilistic models of failure 113 
the Type / failure. In the second, single-risk, model these exponential 
distributions are the underlying distributions of failure-time. In the 
double-risk model 
fi(x) = X,e-^^\ 
so that from (11), the p.d.f. li(x) of the underlying distribution of 
Type I failure-time is

10.4. Dependence of failures on wear 
In some applications it may be helpful to consider failure as dependent 
on a physical property of the component, which we call wear. Let Zx 
be the value of the wear of a component of age x. We define the age- 
wear-specific failure rate as 
pTob(x < X^ x+Ax\x < X,Zx = z) ^.. 
^fcx) = hm -> (1) 
An important special case is when ^(z,x) is a function of z only, so 
that given the wear, age is of no value as a predictor of failure. It 
would be possible to deal with multi-dimensional wear variables, but 
this will not be done here. When {Z^} is a stochastic process of 
specified structure and the function ^(z,x) is given, we have a  
probabilistic model of wear and failure. We shall consider a number of 
special cases. 
First suppose that Z^ can take on two values only, 0 and 1 say, 
satisfactory and unsatisfactory. In the most general model of this type 
we have 
m^) = <^oW, 4>{\,x) = u^). (2) 
114 Renewal theory 
If we suppose further that all components start satisfactory and that 
transitions from unsatisfactory to satisfactory are impossible, the 
model is completed by specifying a function A(jc), where 
A(jc) = lim (3) 
Let Piix) (i = 0,1) denote the probability that after time x failure 
has not occurred and that Z^ = i. Then, from the definitions of X{x) 
and <j>i{x), we have that 
Pq{x+Ax) = pq(x){\-X{x) Ax-(f)Q{x) Ax} + o{Ax\ (4) 
Pi{x+Ax) = pi(x){\-(l>i(x)Ax} + X(x)po(x)Ax + o(AxX (5) 
together with the initial conditions po{0) = l,pi(0) = 0. The solution 
of the differential equations resulting from (4) and (5) is 
Po(x) = A(x)0oM (6) 
Pi{x) = 0,(x) J ^-^^ du, (7) 
0 
where 
A(x) = exp - r A(m) duh 0i(x) = exp - J ^j(m) dul (8) 
The p.d.f. of failure-time is 
Mx)Po(x) + cl>i(x)pi(x) (9) 
and, given that failure occurs at age x, the probability that the wear 
at failure is 1 is 
(l>i(x)pi(x) 
<t>oipc)pQ{x) + <l>i(x)pi(x) 
(10) 
The simplest special case is when A(jc), ^oW> ^^^ ^iW are all 
constant. Then the p.d.f. of failure-time is 
fcii)(A+^)^-A.-<^..+ ^i ^-<^.. (11) 
X + 9o — (pi A + ^Q —9i 
Probabilistic models of failure 115 
This has a rational Laplace transform and so is an Erlangian  
distribution. In this case the 'stage' interpretation of failure has a physical 
meaning and an alternative derivation of (11) is easily obtained by 
noting that with probability ^o/(^o + ^ failure occurs after one stage, 
exponentially distributed with parameter ^o + K whereas with  
probability A/(^o+'^) failure occurs after two stages independently  
exponentially distributed with parameters ^o + '^ and ^i. Clearly a 
range of Erlangian distributions can be generated in this way. 
The second simple special case is when failure occurs immediately 
the wear Zx exceeds some fixed critical level zq. That is, wear is a 
perfect predictor of failure. The failure-time is now the first passage 
time of the stochastic process {Z^} across the barrier zq. For suitably 
simple {Zx} the distribution of failure-time can be determined  
explicitly. For example, suppose that wear is produced by a series of 
' blows' occurring in a Poisson process, or more generally in a renewal 
process. Suppose also that the wear at the /th blow is a positive random 
variable Wi, the sequence {Wi) being independent identically  
distributed random variables independent of the renewal process. If wear 
is additive, we have a cumulative process of the type discussed in 
section 8.3 and the theory of first passage times in section 8.4 will 
apply. 
In particular if a large number of steps are necessary to reach zo, 
the distribution of failure-time will be nearly normal. Also, if the 
wear per blow is constant, the failure-time is the time for a fixed 
number of renewals to occur in the underlying renewal process of 
blows. If this underlying renewal process is a Poisson process, the 
distribution of failure-time will be of the special Erlangian type with 
a stages, where a is the number of blows necessary to produce failure. 
The final special case is due to Mercer (1961). As it is more  
complicated we shall not go into details here. Wear is considered as  
produced by blows in a Poisson process, the wear per blow having a 
gamma distribution, reasonably simple results being obtained when 
the wear per blow is either constant or has an exponential distribution. 
Finally it is assumed that the age-wear-specific failure rate has the 
form^i(/) + z^2- 
CHAPTER 11 
Strategies of Replacement 
11.1. Introduction 
We now consider some more specialized problems connected  
specifically with the replacement of components such as electric light bulbs, 
valves, etc. The main topic concerns whether a strategy of scheduled 
replacement before failure is likely to be preferable to a strategy of 
using all components until failure. A discussion on this in a practical 
case will depend on considerations not all of which can be  
incorporated into a mathematical analysis. All we do here is to investigate 
some idealized systems. 
The following assumptions will be made throughout: 
(a) components are completely effective until they fail, after which 
they are completely ineffective. We exclude replacement problems 
arising from gradual deterioration in performance or from gradually 
increasing maintenance costs; 
(b) we ignore queueing problems arising because several  
components fail simultaneously and repair facilities are limited; 
(c) when a renewal occurs, either a completely new component is 
inserted, or the old component is repaired so that the p.d.f. of its 
future life-time is that of a new component; 
(d) the p.d.f./(x) of failure-time is known. 
Assumption (c) can be relaxed provided that an explicit assumption 
can be made about the distribution of failure-time for the repaired 
components. Assumption (d) is important. Rational discussion of 
replacement strategies is impossible without fairly detailed  
information about the distribution. 
Suppose that there are two types of replacement: 
(i) service replacements made after failure, 
(ii) planned replacements made before failure. 
116 
Strategies of replacement 117 
It is assumed that the average cost Cg of a service replacement exceeds 
the average cost Cp of a planned replacement. The basis for comparing 
strategies will be the average cost of replacements per unit time. Of 
course in a practical case careful consideration has to be given to 
deciding which costs in the system contribute to c^ and to Cp. 
11.2. Some simple strategies 
We start by considering three simple strategies. 
Strategy A. Make service replacements only. 
Strategy B. Make a planned replacement at times t^, 2tb, ...,  
irrespective of the age of the component then in use. When a failure 
occurs make a service replacement. 
Strategy C. Make a planned replacement if and only if the age of 
the component in use reaches t^. When a failure occurs make a service 
replacement. 
In a general way, strategies B and C are likely to be effective only 
if there is substantial increase with x in the age-specific failure rate 
(t)(x). Other things being equal. Strategy C is preferable to Strategy B, 
since, in following Strategy B, a planned replacement may be made 
of a component that has only just previously been brought into use. 
The Strategy B may, however, be appropriate if inspection of the 
system is necessary for some other reason at intervals t^. Strategy B 
can be improved in various ways, for example by not renewing  
components which are almost new. 
The mean cost per unit time of Strategy A is 
Ca = cjfx, (1) 
where /x is the mean failure-time. For in a long time T there will be 
nearly r//x failures. 
To find the corresponding cost for Strategy B consider a time 
period t^ starting with a planned replacement. In this period the 
average number of service replacements is given by the renewal 
function for the corresponding renewal process and in the notation 
of section 4.1 is HjJb). There is in the period just one planned  
replacement so that the average cost for the period is 
Cp+CsHo{tb) 
118 Renewal theory 
and therefore the mean cost per unit time is 
^B ;; K"^) 
h 
For Strategy C, note first that the probability that a given  
component's life is ended by a planned replacement is ^{t^. Further, the 
mean length of time for which a given component is used is 
J xf{x) dx +1, ^(t,) = J .^(x) dx. 
0 0 
Consider a very large number m of components. The expected total 
cost involved in replacing them is 
m^{OCp + m{l-^(Q}c,. 
The expected length of time for which the components are in use is 
m 
0 
-c 
{ ^{x)dx 
Hence the mean cost per unit time of Strategy C is 
Cs-i.Cs-Cp)^{Q 
Cc = -^]; ' --' (3) 
j ^(x)dx 
0 
It is possible to find simple sufficient conditions for Strategies B and 
C to be preferable to Strategy A. First, by (4.2.3), as /^-> oo, 
/x 111 
Hence for large tb 
Ho{h) = - + -^~ + o{\). (4) 
C, = ^-fi|c-f^^^V^l-f.(.r^ (5) 
Strategies of replacement 119 
On comparing (5) with (1), we have that Strategy B for large t^ is 
preferable to Strategy A if 
i<\H)- 
(6) 
Now if o-^/jLt^ is small, Ho{tb) is likely to fall appreciably below its 
asymptotic value (4), especially near tb = ifx, f/x, .... Hence in such 
cases more detailed investigation is necessary before rejecting 
Strategy B. Detailed analysis will be necessary also to find the  
optimum value of tf,. All that we can say from (5) is that the smaller t^ 
consistent with (4) the better. A good approximation to the optimum 
th will usually be given by that value for which Ho{th) falls most below 
its limiting form (4). 
For Strategy C, we have from (3) that Cc-^cJfjL as /^-^ °o, since 
0 
Hence a sufficient condition that Cc is preferable to C^ is that Cc is 
an increasing function of t^ for large t^. Now 
- (log Cc) = 
J ^{x)dx 
0 
J {c,-c,)4>{t,) 1 \ 
J ^{x)dx 
0 
where ^(a:) is the age-specific failure-rate, and ^(oo) is its limit, 
possibly infinite, as x->oo. 
120 Renewal theory 
Hence a sufficient condition for Strategy C to be preferable to 
Strategy A is that 
^^(00) >-^. (8) 
The optimum value of t^ can be found in a more detailed  
investigation of Cc made from the simple formula (3). 
11.3. A strategy involving idle time 
In some applications where strategies similar to B are used, the 
following complication may arise. If a failure occurs just before one 
of the planned replacement points /^, 2/^,..., it may be preferable to 
postpone replacement until the planned replacement point. As a 
result the system will be idle for a certain time, or, perhaps more 
realistically, may function less efficiently. Let the cost of a period of 
idle time of length / be c]+ cj /, where possibly c/ = 0. 
We consider Strategy D defined as follows. 
Strategy D. Let replacements be made as in Strategy B, except that 
if a failure occurs in an interval (r/^— /j, r/^), the system is left idle 
up to time r/^ (r = 1, 2,...). 
To evaluate C^, the cost per unit time for this strategy, note that 
the mean number of service replacements per period t^ is Hoitb— t^). 
It remains to find the contribution of idle time to the mean cost per 
unit time. Now for any period the idle time is equal to 
0 iU,^^t,X 
where t/^ ^ is the backward recurrence time of section 5.1. The p.d.f. of 
Ufj^ is ho{tb-'x)^{x) for x < t^, where ho(t) is the renewal density. 
Hence the contribution of idle time to the mean cost per period is 
f (c]+cJx)hoith-x)^(x)dx. (2) 
Strategies of replacement 121 
Therefore 
Cd = jVp-^^sHoitb-td) + \ {c'i+c;X)hJJb-x)^(x)dx • (3) 
The condition that it should be profitable to allow idle time, i.e. to 
take td > 0, is that the partial derivative of C^ with respect to r^ should 
be negative at td = 0, i.e. that 
Cs > C-r (4) 
In particular if c / = 0 it is always profitable to allow idle time. 
Assuming (4) to be satisfied, we can find, the optimum value of td, 
denoted by id, by equating the partial derivative to zero. We get the 
equation 
Cs = ic\ + crtd)ntd\ (5) 
This can be solved for id when the survivor function and the costs are 
known. However, it is likely very often that id will be small, ^(/j) '^ 1, 
when 
h-^' (6) 
If the functions HJit) and hjj) vary little over a period td, we can 
treat hoit^-x) as constant in (3) and also can write 
Hoitb-td) -- Ho(th)'-tdhM)' 
Thus 
1 
Cd - z{^p + c,Ho{ti,)-c,tdho(th) + hM)(c'itd+icJtj)} 
= Cs+^(-c,td+c]td+icJtj). (7) 
When td is given its optimum value (6), we have that 
^ ^ ho(tb)(c,-Ci)^ 
^D '^ ^B z:—^ W 
2tbCi 
If tf, is not too small we can replace ho(th) by its limiting value, l/fx. 
122 Renewal theory 
11.4. Strategies involving wear 
So far we have considered strategies in which age is the only property 
of a component involved in the decision about its replacement. We 
now deal with a replacement problem in which the wear of  
components can be measured, restricting attention to the simplest model 
of section 10.4 in which there are only two levels of wear, 0 and 1, 
and the associated transition probabilities are constant, so that in 
particular the p.d.f. of failure-time is (10.4.11). 
Two strategies will be considered. 
Strategy E. Make a planned replacement immediately the wear 
becomes 1. Make a service replacement on failure. 
Strategy F. Inspect the system at times (fy, Itf,...). Make a planned 
replacement if the wear is 1. Make a service replacement on failure. 
In following Strategy E, the time for which a component is used is 
exponentially distributed with parameter A+^i. Its use ends with a 
service replacement with probability <j>\l{X + <j>\) and with a planned 
replacement with probability A/(A + ^i). Hence 
Q= c,(t>Q + CpX. (1) 
The mean failure-time is (A + ^i)/{^i(A + ^o)} ^^^ hence the cost 
per unit time for Strategy A is 
^ ^ ^i(A + ^o)c^ 
^ (A + <^i) 
Thus Ce < C^ if and only if 
Cs A + ^i 
The condition most favourable to Strategy E is that in which failures 
never occur at zero wear, ^o = 0, but occur very soon after transition 
to unit wear, i.e. ^i > A. Then (2) becomes Cp/Cs < 1. 
To calculate the cost per unit time for Strategy F, consider one 
period of length /y. Since the component in use at the beginning of a 
Strategies of replacement 123 
period always has zero wear, all periods are statistically equivalent. 
We need the results of two preliminary calculations, first for the mean 
number of failures in time //and second for the probability that after 
time //the wear of the component in use is 1. 
The first is given by Hjjf), the renewal function for the ordinary 
renewal process with p.d.f. of failure-time (10.4.11). The Laplace 
transform of (10.4.11) is 
(5+A+<^o)(^+<^i) 
and hence, by (4.1.4), 
(5(^0+^0^1 + ^0 
H^{s) = 
5l5 + A + ^l) 
^i(A+<^o) 1 Kh'-<l>o) 1 A(^i-(^o) 
(A+<^i) 's^ (A+<^i)'-~^ (A + <^i)'(5+A + <^i)* ^^ 
Therefore 
(A + ^l) (A + 0i) 
For the second calculation, consider the stochastic process defined 
by the wear of the component currently in use. That is, if a  
component with zero wear fails, no transition in the process occurs, 
because the new component has zero wear. Under the present 
assumptions, the transition probability densities are constant. In fact 
the process is the simplest type of Markov process in continuous time.

As /y-^ 00, the cost Cf tends to C^, the cost when there are service 
replacements only. As tf-^0, the cost Cp tends to C^. The condition 
that Cjr should be close to C^ is that (A + ^i) /y > 1. 
The advantage of using wear rather than age as the condition for 
replacement can be assessed numerically by comparing C^, given by 
(1), with Cb and Cc, given by (5), (2.2), (2.3) and (10.4.11). The 
resulting formulae are rather complicated and will not be given. 
APPENDIX I 
Bibliographical Notes 
General The references in the main part of this monograph have been 
kept to a minimum. Those given are necessary either for following up 
subjects dealt with only in outline or for finding out about general 
mathematical or statistical matters, a knowledge of which is to be 
assumed. Smith (1958) has given an excellent account of the general 
mathematical theorems of renewal theory, and has given a number 
of advanced developments, especially concerning problems about 
electronic counters. This paper contains references to most of the 
more important papers on renewal theory published between about 
1948 and 1958. Earlier work is summarized by Lotka (1939) and 
Frechet (1949). Current work on renewal theory may be found in 
mathematical, statistical or operational research journals, depending 
on its particular emphasis. Such work is most easily traced through 
either Mathematical Reviews or International Journal of Abstracts: 
Statistical Theory and Method. 
Chapter 1. Nearly all the material in this chapter is standard. For 
Erlang's work on stages (section 1.4 (iii), (iv)), see Jensen (1948). Cox 
(1955) has considered extensions using complex transition  
probabilities. The simplifications arising in renewal theory when the 
Laplace transform is rational have been widely exploited, but the 
explicit use of the 'stage' device seems new. 
Chapter 2. Feller (1948,1949) stressed that renewal theory is  
important for studying a wide class of stochastic processes and thoroughly 
discussed the theory for discrete time (Feller, 1949, 1957). The 
equilibrium renewal process was considered by Doob (1948); see also 
Cox and Smith (1954). The application of renewal theory to  
electronic counters (section 2.4) was started by Feller (1948). Smith (1958) 
has extended and reviewed this work. 
125 
126 Renewal theory 
Chapter 3. The usefulness of the simple relation (3.1.1), especially for 
asymptotic theory, was stressed by Feller (1949, 1957). Skellam and 
Shenton (1957) gave many exact results for the distribution of A^^ and 
for other related properties of renewal processes. The material in 
section 3.4 is dealt with in more detail by Cox (1960). 
Chapter 4. Smith (1954) proved, under very weak conditions, the 
asymptotic result (4.2.3) for the renewal function. Early work in 
renewal theory concentrated especially on the renewal density  
(section 4.4). Feller (1941) gave the first rigorous proof of the convergence 
of the renewal density to a limit; Smith (1960) has given a remarkable 
necessary and sufficient condition for convergence. The integral 
equation of renewal theory occurs in the deterministic theory of a 
number of types of growth process. The use of Wald's identity to 
obtain the higher moments of A^^ follows Bartlett (1949), the important 
inverse relation (4.6.4) being due to Tweedie (1945). 
Chapter 5. Recurrence-time problems are important in stochastic 
processes generally and Bartlett (1955, pp. 56-67) has given a rather 
general discussion. Takacs (1960) has given an argument equivalent 
to that of section 5.4. Owen (1949) and Skellam and Shenton (1957) 
have discussed the number of renewals in an interval not starting at 
the origin. 
Chapter 6. The superposition of processes is considered by Palm 
(1943), Cox and Smith (1953a, 1954), Cox (1959) and Khintchine 
(1960, Chapter 5). 
Chapter 7. Cane (1959) and Page (1959) have considered applications 
of alternating renewal processes to, respectively, animal ethology and 
the maintenance of electronic computers. The important concept 
(section 7.1) of a semi-Markov process is due independently to Smith 
(1955) and Levy (1954). 
Chapter 8. The main references are given in the text. A number of 
special cases of Smith's general theorem, outlined in section 8.5, have 
since been given in the literature. Mercer and Smith (1959) investigated 
Bibliographical notes 127 
cumulative processes associated with a Poisson process, in connexion 
with a study of the wear of conveyor belting. 
Chapter 9. A further discussion of generalizations is given by Smith 
(1958). Cox and Smith (1953b) and Smith (1961) have studied renewal 
theory when the failure-times, although independent, are not 
identically distributed. Since renewal theory is, in a sense, a very 
special case of the theory of random walk, the very substantial 
literature on random walk is relevant. 
Chapter 10. Buckland (1962) has given a bibliographic account of 
work on probabilistic models of failure. The asymptotic theory of 
extreme values (section 10.2) is discussed very thoroughly by Gumbel 
(1958). A model of failure with wear, rather similar to that of section 
10.4, is discussed by Bovaird (1961). The bibliography of Mendenhall 
(1958) on life-testing is useful in connexion with Chapters 10 and 11. 
Chapter 11. The extensive operational research literature on  
replacement theory is reviewed by Dean (1961). Replacement theory with 
measured wear is considered by Mercer (1961) and by Bovaird (1961). 
Crookes (1961) has discussed the formulae of sections 11.2, 11.3 in 
more detail and has given tables and graphs for use when there is a 
special Erlangian distribution of failure-time.

time t—um the ordinary renewal process starting at the first renewal. 
The p.d.f. of time up to the first renewal is, by definition, ^{x)/ijl;
