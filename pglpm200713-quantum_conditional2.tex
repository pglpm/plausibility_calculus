%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In a recent manuscript, Gelman \amp\ Yao \citey{gelmanetal2020} claim that
\enquote{the usual rules of conditional probability fail in the quantum
  realm} and purport to support that statement with an Young-slit example.
Such a statement is false. In the present note I recall some literature in
quantum theory that shows why it is false, sum up the incorrect reasoning
underlying their example, and also correct some wrong or imprecise
statements about the quantum physics in that example.

In fact, an opposite statement can be made, from two different
perspectives, which will be discussed in the rest of this note:
\begin{itemize}
\item The example given in that manuscript confirms, rather than
  invalidate, the probability rules. The probability calculus shows that a
  particular relation between probabilities \emph{cannot a priori} be
  assumed to be an equality or an inequality. In the quantum example it
  turns out to be an inequality, thus confirming what the probability
  calculus says.
\item But actually the same inequality can be shown to appear in very
  non-quantum examples, such as drawing from an urn. Thus there is nothing
  peculiar to quantum theory in this matter.
\end{itemize}

Also, let me point out at the outset that the rule of conditional
probability (and the other two rules, sum and negation) are in fact
routinely used in quantum theory, with full validity, especially in
problems of state \enquote{retrodiction} and measurement reconstruction
\citep{jones1991b,slater1995b}[\chaps~7,8]{demuynck2002b}{barnettetal2003,zimanetal2004_r2006,darianoetal2004}[see][\sect~1
for many further references]{maanssonetal2006}, for example to infer the
state of a quantum laser given its output through different optical
apparatus \citep{leonhardt1997}.

Similar incorrect claims with similar examples have appeared before in the
quantum literature. Bernard O. Koopman \citep[of the Pitman-Koopman
theorem for sufficient statistics,][]{koopman1936} discussed the
falsity of such claims already in \cite*{koopman1957}. The Introduction in
his work is very clear:
\begin{quotation}\footnotesize
  Ever since the advent of modern quantum mechanics in the late
  1920's, the idea has been prevalent that the classical laws of
  probability cease, in some sense, to be valid in the new theory. More or
  less explicit statements to this effect have been made in large number
  and by many of the most eminent workers in the new physics \textelp{}.
  Some authors have even gone farther and stated that the formal structure
  of logic must be altered to conform to the terms of reference of quantum
  physics \textelp{}.

  Such a thesis is surprising, to say the least, to anyone holding more or
  less conventional views regarding the positions of logic, probability,
  and experimental science: many of us have been apt -- perhaps too naively
  -- to assume that experiments can lead to conclusions only when worked up
  by means of logic and probability, whose laws seem to be on a different
  level from those of physical science.

  The primary object of this presentation is to show that the thesis in
  question is entirely without validity and is the product of a confused
  view of the laws of probability.
\end{quotation}

A claim somewhat similar to Gelman \amp\ Yao's, with a similar supporting
example, was made in a work by Brukner \amp\ Zeilinger
\citey{brukneretal2001}; although their focus was on an alleged
inconsistency of some properties of the Shannon entropy in quantum theory.

The fallacy in their reasoning, which is similar to Gelman \amp\ Yao's,
rests in the neglect of the experimental setup, leading either to an
incorrect calculation of conditional probabilities, or to the incorrect
claim that the probability calculus yields an equality, whereas it actually
does not. The incorrect reasoning was discussed at length by Porta Mana
\citey{portamana2003_r2004} through a step-by-step analysis and
calculation. This work also showed, through simple examples
\citep[\sect~IV]{portamana2003_r2004}, that the same incorrect
statements can be obtained \emph{with completely non-quantum systems}, such
as drawing from an urn, if the setup is neglected. Let us start with such a
counter-example.

\bigskip

\paragraph{A non-quantum counter-example}

Consider an urn with one $B$lue and one $R$ed ball. There are two possible
drawing setups:
\begin{enumerate}[label=$D_{\textrm{\alph*}}$]
\item\label{item:repB} With replacement for blue, without replacement for
  red. That is, if blue is drawn, it is put back before the next draw (and
  the urn is shaken); if red is drawn, it is thrown away before the next
  draw.
\item \label{item:repR} With replacement for red, without replacement for blue.
\end{enumerate}
These two setups are obviously mutually exclusive.

We can easily find the unconditional probability for blue at the
second draw in the setup $\yDa$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:A_red2}
  \p(B_{2} \| \yDa) = \tfrac{3}{4} \;.
\end{equation}
Note that these can be intuitively found by simple enumeration, \`a la
Boole, with a \enquote{possible worlds} diagram. Out of four possible
worlds, half of which has blue at the first draw, and the other half has
red, we see that three worlds have blue at the second draw.

The conditional probabilities for blue at the second draw,
conditional on the first draw, are also easily found:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:A_red2cond}
  \p(B_{2} \| B_{1} \land \yDa) = \tfrac{1}{2} \qquad
  \p(B_{2} \| R_{1} \land \yDa) = 1 \;.
\end{equation}
We find that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:A_rule}
  \p(B_{2} \| \yDa) =%\mathrel{\bm{\ne}}
  \p(B_{2} \| B_{1} \land \yDa) \; \p( B_{1} \| \yDa) +
  \p(B_{2} \| R_{1} \land \yDa)  \; \p( R_{1} \| \yDa) \;,
\end{equation}
which is just the rule of conditional probability. It is in fact just the
systematization and generalization of the intuitive \enquote{possible
  worlds} reasoning done above.

Now consider the setup $\yDb$. We easily find
\begin{gather}
  \label{eq:B_red2}
  \p(B_{2} \| \yDb) = \tfrac{1}{4} \;.
  \\
  \label{eq:B_red2cond}
  \p(B_{2} \| B_{1} \land \yDb) = 0 \qquad
  \p(B_{2} \| R_{1} \land \yDb) = \tfrac{1}{2} \;,
  \\
  \label{eq:B_rule}
  \p(B_{2} \| \yDb) =%\mathrel{\bm{\ne}}
  \p(B_{2} \| B_{1} \land \yDb) \; \p( B_{1} \| \yDb) +
  \p(B_{2} \| R_{1} \land \yDb)  \; \p( R_{1} \| \yDb) \;.
\end{gather}


\medskip

Now compare the unconditional probability for blue at the second draw in
the setup $\yDa$, with the  probabilities for blue at the second draw
conditional on the first in the setup $\yDb$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cross_combine}
  \p(B_{2} \| \yDa) \mathrel{\bm{\ne}}
  \p(B_{2} \| B_{1} \land \yDb) \; \p( B_{1} \| \yDb) +
  \p(B_{2} \| R_{1} \land \yDb)  \; \p( R_{1} \| \yDb) \;.
\end{equation}
This inequality is not surprising -- we are comparing different setugs. It
is \emph{not} an instance of the conditional-probability rule. In fact the
probability calculus has nothing to say about the relation between the left
side and right side, which are conditional on different statements or, if
you like, pertain to two different sample spaces.

You can call the inequality above \enquote{interference} if you like; for
further examples see Kirkpatrick
\citey{kirkpatrick2001_r2003,kirkpatrick2002_r2003} and Porta Mana
\citey[\sect~IV]{portamana2003_r2004}.

\medskip

Now consider another pair of drawing setups: setup $\yDc$, with replacement
for both colours; and setup $\yDd$, without replacement for either colour.
You can easily find that
\begin{gather}
  \p(B_{2} \| \yDc) =%\mathrel{\bm{\ne}}
  \p(B_{2} \| B_{1} \land \yDc) \; \p( B_{1} \| \yDc) +
  \p(B_{2} \| R_{1} \land \yDc)  \; \p( R_{1} \| \yDc) \;,
  \\
  \p(B_{2} \| \yDd) =%\mathrel{\bm{\ne}}
  \p(B_{2} \| B_{1} \land \yDd) \; \p( B_{1} \| \yDd) +
  \p(B_{2} \| R_{1} \land \yDd)  \; \p( R_{1} \| \yDd) \;,
  \\
  \label{eq:cross_combine_same}
  \p(B_{2} \| \yDc) \mathrel{\bm{=}}
  \p(B_{2} \| B_{1} \land \yDd) \; \p( B_{1} \| \yDd) +
  \p(B_{2} \| R_{1} \land \yDd)  \; \p( R_{1} \| \yDd) \;.
\end{gather}
The first two equalities are expressions of the conditional-probability
rule. The last, however, is \emph{not}, despite being an equality. It is
simply a peculiar equality contingent on the two specific setups.

The probability calculus thus correctly handles situations such
as~\eqref{eq:cross_combine} and~\eqref{eq:cross_combine_same}.

\medskip

Strictly speaking it is wrong to use the expression \defquote{$B_{2}$} for
all these setups, because \defquote{$B_{2}$} in each setup denotes a
different statement (or random variable) than in the others. Just like
\enquote{it rains (on 2020-07-14T09:00+0200 in Trondheim)} is different
from \enquote{it rains (on 2019-01-20T18:00+0200 in Rome)}. I should have
used different symbols. The explicit presence of \defquote{$D_{\dotso}$},
which represents given information, luckily avoided any ambiguities. But if
in our formulae we omit the notation of the setup \emph{and} we use the
same notation for actually different statements or random variables, then
we're in for trouble and for incorrect applications of the probability
rules.

\medskip

The inequality~\eqref{eq:cross_combine} is what Gelman \amp\ Yao
\citey[p.~2]{gelmanetal2020} complain about, but in the context of a pair
of quantum setups. I do not see how one can complain about it, or claim
inconsistencies. It is obviously correct even from an intuitive analysis of
the two setups, and the probability calculus, correctly, also leads to it.
The probability calculus correctly leads also to the
equality~\eqref{eq:cross_combine_same}. As already said, given two mutually
exclusive setups, the probability calculus a priori neither commits to an
equality nor to an inequality.


I will now show that the simple example above is conceptually actually
quite close to the quantum experiment mentioned by Gelman \amp\ Yao -- and
also correct some statements they make about that experiment. The closeness
is especially clear from the experimental and mathematical developments of
quantum theory of the past 40 years (at the very least), as the literature
cited below shows.

\bigskip

\paragraph{The quantum two-slit experiments}

The basic argument of Gelman \amp\ Yao is that, in a given setup of the
quantum two-slit experiment, we have a specific probability distribution
for the appearance of an emulsion or excitation on some point of the
screen. We can call this a \enquote{screen detection}, but please keep in
mind that in so doing we are adding an extra interpretation that modern
quantum theory does not actually commit to -- see references below. In a
different experimental setup we have conditional probabilities for screen
detection conditional on slit detection. Now, the probability in the first
setup is not equal to the combination of the conditional probabilities of
the second setup.

But this is exactly what happens in the urn example above,
\eqn~\eqref{eq:cross_combine}. Also in this quantum case it is \emph{not} a
violation of the conditional probability rule -- if anything it is a
confirmation.

To see the analogy more clearly, let me present some additional facts from
quantum theory.

\medskip

The experimental setup without detectors at the slits, the two setups with
one slit closed, and the setup with slit detectors are actually limit cases
of a continuum of experimental setups \citep{woottersetal1979}[for a recent
review and further references see]{banaszeketal2013}. In the general case,
such a setup has \enquote{noisy} slit detectors, with a degree of noise
$q \in \clcl{1/2, 1}$ that can be chosen in the setup. These noise degrees
are of course mutually exclusive, so these setups are mutually exclusive.

The slit detector is called \enquote{noisy} in the following sense. Let us
call $y$ the detection position on the screen, $\yxa$ the statement that
detection occurs at slit \#1, and $\yxb$ at slit \#2 (you can translate to
random-variable notation if you prefer). We can prepare the electromagnetic
field (quantum state $S_{1}$) in such a way that, in the setup with
non-noisy slit detectors, detector \#1 always fires; that is, statement
$\yxa$ has probability 1 and statement $\yxb$ has probability 0 in this
setup. We can also prepare a state $S_{2}$ such that the opposite holds:
$\yxa$ has zero probability, and $\yxb$ unit probability.

If we prepare these states, but use the setup with noisy detectors of
degree $q$ -- denote this setup by $\yDq$ -- then we have probability $q$
that slit detector \#1 fires for state $S_{1}$, and that \#2 fires for
state $S_{2}$ (the probabilities of the other slit are $1-q$). That is, the
statements $\yxa$ and $\yxb$ have probabilities $q$ and $1-q$. (We should
actually not be using the same $X$ symbol for all such setups, because the
sample spaces are different; see the discussion for the urn example). The
setup with non-noisy detectors is the limit case $q=1$. In the limit, fully
noisy case $q=1/2$ there is basically no relation between the light states
and the firing of the slit detectors; that is, we are always fully
uncertain as to what detector would fire, no matter how the light state is
prepared.
  
In each setup $\yDq$ (and given the light state $S$) we also have the
conditional probability distribution $\pf(y \| \yDq,S)$ for detection at
$y$ on the screen, and the conditional probability distributions
$\pf(y \| X,\yDq,S)$ for detection at $y$ on the screen, conditional on
detection $X$ at the slits. We have
\begin{multline}
  \label{eq:conditional_q}
  \pf(y \| \yDq, S) ={}\\
  \pf(y \| \yxa, \yDq, S) \;\pf( \yxa \| \yDq, S) +
  \pf(y \| \yxb, \yDq, S) \;\pf( \yxb \| \yDq, S) \;.
\end{multline}
This is an instance of the conditional-probability rule. This equality also
holds for long-run frequencies (see point \ref{item:q_prob_freq} below).
Note that such frequencies are experimentally observed. I would like you to
convince yourself, though, that the \emph{equality} above (not the specific
values of the frequencies) is not an experimental fact, since it rests on
the very definition of conditional frequency.

The conditional and unconditional distributions above will of course be
different depending on the setup $\yDq$ and the light state $S$.

There are a couple of interesting experimental facts about this collection
of setups:

First, \emph{both the conditional and unconditional} probability (or
long-run frequency) distributions for the screen detection $y$ generally
have an oscillatory profile (depending on the specific light state, of
course, which we assume fixed), typical of interference
\citep{woottersetal1979,banaszeketal2013}[see also][for further
variations]{chiaoetal1995}. The oscillatory character is maximal for
$q=1/2$ and decreases as $q \to 1$; for $q=1$ it is gone completely.
  
Second, the unconditional (frequency) distribution that we observe in the
setup without slit detectors is experimentally equal to that observed in
the setup $D_{1/2}$ with fully noisy slit detectors.

Third, one conditional distribution observed in the setup with one slit
closed is experimentally equal to one in the setup $D_{1}$ with perfect
slit detectors. Here we must be careful, because there is no slit detection
in the second setup; rather, we speak of appearance or non-appearance at
the screen, and in the latter case no conditional distribution is defined.

Note that the equalities in the last two cases should not be expected a
priori, because the setups are physically different. Of course one can look
for physical, \enquote{hidden variables} explanations of such equalities.
Experimental quantum optics simply acknowledges the fact that two setups
are equivalent for such detection purposes.

\medskip

It should be noted how this range of cases in statistically analogous to
the urn examples and setups previously discussed. In each setup, the rule
of conditional probability holds (and in the quantum case we can have
distributions, conditional and unconditional, with oscillatory profiles).
Across different setups probability theory says that such a rule cannot be
applied; and indeed we find inequalities across some setups and equalities
across others, both in the quantum and non-quantum case, see
\eqns~\eqref{eq:cross_combine}, \eqref{eq:cross_combine_same}.



  It is also possible to consider situations where part of the setup, such
  as slit width or presence or absence of detectors, is unknown. This is
  similar, in the urn example above, to not knowing whether $\yDa$ or
  $\yDb$ applies. In this case one can make inferences by giving the
  probability for each setup, \eg\ $\p(\yDa)$, and applying the
  conditional-probability rule. The same rule is indeed applied in the
  analogous quantum situation \citep[\eg][]{zimanetal2004_r2006}.
  Again, no violations of the probability rules in the quantum realm.

\paragraph{Further remarks and curiosities about quantum two-slits
  experiments}

I would like to mention a couple more experimental facts -- which are,
besides, statistically very interesting -- to correct some statements by
Gelman \amp\ Yao in relation to the two-slit experiment.
% discussion the experiment further, also mentioning latent variables, but
% their discussion is misleading and incorrect from some points of view.
% Therefore I would like to remark on some very interesting facts and provide
% literature about this quantum experiment.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\textbf{\roman*})]
%\item\label{item:continnum_experiments} 
\item\label{item:q_details} It \emph{does} matter whether many photons are
  sent at once, or one at a time \citep[\cf][\sect~2
  point~1]{gelmanetal2020}; as well as their wavelength, temporal spread,
  and so on. These details are part of the specification of the light state
  $S$ mentioned above, and lead to different probabilities distributions of
  detection at the screen.

  For example, in some setups and for some states we can have a detection
  probability density $\pf(y_{1})$ for the first photon, and a
  \emph{different} density for the second photon $\pf(y_{2} \| y_{1})$,
  conditional on the detection of the first -- both being different from
  the long-run joint density of detections $f(y)$. See \eg\ the phenomena
  of higher-order coherence, bunching, anti-bunching, and so
  on\footcites[\eg][]{mandeletal1965,morganetal1966,paul1982,jacobsonetal1995}[and
  textbooks such
  as][]{loudon1973_r2000,mandeletal1995_r2008,scullyetal1997_r2001,bachoretal1998_r2004,wallsetal1994}.
  Interference phenomena can also be observed in time, not only in space.

  The rules of the probability calculus also apply in such situations. We
  can infer, for example, the position of the first photon detection given
  the second from
  $\pf(y_{1} \| y_{2}) \propto \pf(y_{2} \| y_{1})\;\pf(y_{1})$.
  

\item\label{item:latent_vars} The details about the light source and the
  setup are not \enquote{latent variables}: they specify the quantum state
  of light and the measurement performed on it. They are like the initial
  and boundary conditions necessary for the specification of the behaviour
  of any physical system. % They correspond to the different drawing
  % setups in the urn example above -- we would not call the specification
  % \enquote{drawing with replacement} a latent variable. The rules of
  % probability apply seamlessly in each case.

\item\label{item:q_prob_freq} In view of point~\ref{item:q_details} above,
  it is important not to conflate the \emph{probabilities} for
  single-photon detections and the \emph{frequency} distribution of a
  long-run of such detections \citep[\sect~2, seem to conflate the
  two]{gelmanetal2020}.
%  
% \item\label{item:q_slitclosed_vs_detect} The long-run frequency
%   distribution for screen detection in the setup with one slit open
%   (denoted \defquote{$p_1(y)$} by Gelman \amp\ Yao), and the one
%   conditional on slit detection in the setup with detectors at the slits
%   (\defquote{$p_{4}(y \| x)$}) are a priori unrelated, since they belong to
%   different setups. In some situations (but not always, see points
%   \ref{item:q_details}, \ref{item:q_prob_freq} above) they experimentally
%   turn out to be equal. But this was not required by the probability
%   calculus. Such equality is similar to \eqn~\eqref{eq:cross_combine_same}
%   between the with-replacement and without-replacement urn setups, which is
%   not an a priori rule of the probability calculus, and in fact does not
%   hold for the setups in \eqn~\eqref{eq:cross_combine}.

% \item In the setup with one or both slits open, the quantity
%   \enquote{detection at slit $x$} \emph{does not exist}, because no such
%   measurement is included in the setup. So in these cases the idea of a
%   marginal probability does not even apply.

%   Of course one is free to introduce such a quantity within some
%   hidden-variable theory (which goes beyond the quantum realm), such as
%   Bohmian mechanics \citep[\!; this theory includes as hidden variables
%   the positions of the particles and the spatial configuration of a
%   so-called pilot wave]{berndletal1995,duerretal2004,valentinietal2005}.
%   But then note, first, that such theory gives experimental predictions in
%   complete agreement with standard quantum theory; and second, that the
%   rules of probability theory are again used without violations in this
%   theory (\eg\ the relation between joint and conditional distributions of
%   the particles' positions, and so on).
%
% \item There is a continuum of possible experimental setups, which includes
%   as special cases the setups without slit detectors, with only one slit
%   open, and with slit detectors.\ibid The corresponding long-run frequency
%   distributions also vary continuously.
\end{enumerate}

I may add that the idea and parlance of \enquote{photons passing through
  slits} are used today only out of tradition; maybe a little poetically.
The technical parlance, as routinely used in quantum-optics labs for
example \citep{leonhardt1997,bachoretal1998_r2004}, has a different
underlying picture. The \defquote{system} in a quantum-optics experiment is
not photons, but the modes of the field-configuration operator\ibid (note
that this is not yet Quantum ElectroDynamics). \enquote{Photon numbers}
denote the discrete outcomes of a specific energy-measurement operator;
\enquote{photon states} denote specific states of the field operators. As
another example, \enquote{entanglement} is strictly speaking not among
photons, but among modes of the field operator \citep{vanenk2003b}. Several
quantum physicists indeed oppose the idea and parlance of
\enquote{photons}, owing to the confusion it leads to. Lamb \citep[of the
Lamb shift,][]{lambetal1947} wrote in \cite*{lamb1995}:
\begin{quote}
  \footnotesize the author does not like the use of the word ``photon'',
  which dates from 1926. In his view, there is no such thing as a photon.
  Only a comedy of errors and historical accidents led to its popularity
  among physicists and optical scientists.
\end{quote}
Wald \citey{wald1994} warns:
\begin{quote}
  \footnotesize standard treatments of quantum field theory in flat
  spacetime rely heavily on Poincar\'e symmetry (usually entering the
  analysis implicitly via plane-wave expansions) and interpret the theory
  primarily in terms of a notion of ``particles''. Neither Poincar\'e (or
  other) symmetry nor a useful notion of ``particles'' exists in a general,
  curved spacetime, so a number of the familiar tools and concepts of field
  theory must be ``unlearned'' in order to have a clear grasp of quantum
  field theory in curved spacetime. [p.~ix] \textelp{} the notion of
  ``particles'' plays no fundamental role either in the formulation or
  interpretation of the theory. [p.~2]

\paragraph{A summary of the modern formalism of quantum theory}

It may be useful to give a summary of how probability enters the modern
formalism of quantum theory. See textbooks such as Holevo
\citey{holevo1980_t2011}, Busch \etal\ \citey{buschetal1995b}, Peres
\citey[especially \chap~12]{peres1995}, de Muynck \citey[especially
\chap~3]{demuynck2002b}, and the excellent text by Bengtsson \amp\
\.Zyczkowski \citey{bengtssonetal2006_r2017}.

A quantum system is defined by its sets of possible states and possible
measurements. A state $\rho$ is represented by an Hermitean, unit-trace
matrix $\yr$ (which satisfies additional mathematical properties), called
\defquote{density matrix}. States traditionally represented by kets
$\lvert \psi \rangle$ are just special cases of density matrices. A
measurement setup $M$ is represented by a set of Hermitean matrices
$\set{\yM_{\bm{r}}}$ (of the same order as the density matrices) adding up
to the identity matrix. They are called \defquote{positive-operator-valued
  measures}, usually abbreviated \defquote{POVM}. Traditional von~Neumann
projection operators $\set{\lvert \phi_{r} \rangle\langle \phi_{r}\rvert}$
are just special cases. Each matrix $\yM_{\bm{r}}$ is associated with an
outcome $\bm{r}$ of the measurement. These outcomes are mutually exclusive.
An outcome can actually represent a combination of simpler outcomes,
$\bm{r}\equiv(x,y,z,\dotsc)$, such as two intensities at two detectors.

The probability of observing outcome $\bm{r}\equiv (x, y, \dotsc)$ given
the measurement setup $M$ and the state $S$ is encoded in the trace-product
of the respective matrices:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:povm_trace}
  \pf(x,y,\dotsc \| M \land S) \equiv \tr(\yM_{x,y,\dotsc}\;\yr) \;,
\end{equation}
forming a probability distribution. Such probabilities come from repeated
measurement experiences in the same experimental conditions -- we could
invoke de~Finetti's theorem here, and some quantum physicists indeed do
\citep{cavesetal2002,vanenketal2002,fuchsetal2004b}.

Once the probability distribution above is given, we can use the
full-fledged probability calculus. We can for example sum (or integrate) over the
detector outcomes $y,\dotsc$, obtaining the marginal probabilities for
the detector outcomes $x$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:povm_trace_marginal}
  \pf(x\| M \land S) \equiv
  \tr\bigl[(\tsum_{y,\dotsc}\yM_{x,y,\dotsc})\;\yr\bigr] \;,
\end{equation}
obviously represented by the matrices $\set{\tsum_{y,\dotsc}\yM_{x,y,\dotsc}}$.


obviously encoded by the matrix


Once the probabilities ab




First, in the experiments with only one slit open or both slits open, the outcome
space is $\set{\textrm{\defquote{no event}}} \cup \RR$, because either an
emulsion is produced at some point on the screen, or none is produced.





After all, we do not expect that marginal probabilities from, say, a
drawing-without-replacement urn setup should be obtainable from the joint
distribution of a drawing-with-replacement setup, or of P\'olya drawings.
These setups are mutually exclusive. A random variable of one of them is
not the same random variable of another. If you thought that you could
consistently combine probabilities from such different urn-drawing setups
and find that you actually cannot, well, too bad for you. The probability
calculus, in fact, makes clear at the outset that the probabilities of these
setups cannot generally be combined. It is thus somewhat funny that one
ends up blaming the probability calculus, which makes a clear distinction,
for one's neglect of that distinction.


Likewise, measurement setups
in quantum theory -- and in many classical-physics situations -- are
generally mutually exclusive.

This kind of incorrect claims about

I refer to the work just cited for the full analysis and counterexamples.
Here I summarize the basic fallacy with a simpler counterexample.

\medskip

The basic fallacy is the confusion of the probability conditional with a
temporal ordering.

Take the conditional probability $\p(A \| B)$, where the statement or event
$A$ refers to a time $t_{2}$, and $B$ to a time $t_{1}$ that precedes
$t_{2}$. This probability is related to the reverse conditional
$\p(B \| A)$ by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:conditional_prob}
  \p(A \| B)\; \p(B) = \p(B \| A) \; \p(A) = \p(A \land B) \;.
\end{equation}
It goes without saying that \emph{the statements or events $A$ and $B$ must
  be the same on both sides of each equation}. In particular, in the
conditional $\p(B \| A)$ the statement $B$ still refers to the time
$t_{1}$, and $A$ to the time $t_{2}$, with $t_{1}$ preceding $t_{2}$. We
can represent these times explicitly and
rewrite~\eqref{eq:conditional_prob} as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:conditional_prob_time}
  \p(A_{2} \| B_{1})\; \p(B_{1}) = \p(B_{1} \| A_{2}) \; \p(A_{2})
  = \p(A_{2} \land B_{1}) \;.
\end{equation}

The fallacy is to think that, in calculating $\p(B \| A)$, we should now
ensure that $B$ refers to time $t_{2}$, and $A$ to time $t_{1}$, \emph{swapping
the times}. But these would be \emph{different} events, not the original
events. In symbols, we would be calculating $\p(B_{2} \| A_{1})$, which is
different from $\p(B_{1} \| A_{2})$, to which the conditional-probability
rule~\eqref{eq:conditional_prob} refers.

Probability theory has nothing to say, a priori, about the relation between
$\p(B_{1} \| A_{2})$ and $\p(B_{2} \| A_{1})$. They are two logically
different situations. A simple example can illustrate this point.

Consider an urn with $R$ed and $B$lue balls. The drawing scheme is with
replacement for blue, and without replacement for red. That is, if a blue
ball is drawn, it is put back in the urn (and the urn shaken) before the
next draw. If a red ball is drawn, it is not put back before the next draw.

The urn initially has one blue and one red ball. The probabilities for the
first draw are straightforward:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1st_draw}
  \p(B_{1}) = \tfrac{1}{2} \qquad \p(R_{1}) = \tfrac{1}{2} \;,
\end{equation}
as are the conditional probabilities for the second draw, conditional on
the first:
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:2nd_draw}
  \begin{align}
    \p(B_{2} \|B_{1}) &= \tfrac{1}{2}
    & \p(R_{2} \| R_{1}) &= 0
      \label{eq:2nd_draw_equal}
    \\[\jot]
    \p(R_{2} \|B_{1}) &= \tfrac{1}{2}
    & \p(B_{2} \| R_{1}) &= 1 \;.
      \label{eq:2nd_draw_mixed}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

These probabilities can be visualized with the \enquote{equiprobable
  worlds} diagram of \fig~\ref{fig:worlds}. In half of the worlds the first
draw yields red; in the other half, blue, according to~\eqref{eq:1st_draw}.
In all worlds with red first, the second must yield blue. In half of the
worlds with blue first, the second yields blue; and in the other half, red;
as for \eqns~\eqref{eq:2nd_draw}.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{framed}
    \centering
    \caption{\enquote{Equiprobable worlds} diagram}\label{fig:worlds}
    \begin{tabular}{p{5em} p{1em} p{1em} p{1em} p{1em} }
      % &\multicolumn{4}{c}{\!\!\!\!\enquote{equiprobable worlds}}
      % \\[1em]
      {{\footnotesize 1st draw}}& R& R & B & B
      \\[1ex]

                                   & $\Big\downarrow$& $\Big\downarrow$
      \\[2ex]
      {{\footnotesize 2nd draw}}& B& B & B & R
    \end{tabular}
  \end{framed}
\end{figure}


Let us now calculate the conditional probabilities for the first draw
conditional on the second (imagine the first draw was hidden from you, and
upon seeing the second you're asked to guess what the first was). Using
the conditional-probability rule~\eqref{eq:conditional_prob_time} in the form of
Bayes's theorem,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bayes}
  \p(X_{1} \| Y_{2}) = \frac{\p(Y_{2} \| X_{1})\, \p(X_{1})}{
   \sum_{X} \p(Y_{2} \| X_{1})\, \p(X_{1})} \;,
\end{equation}
we obtain
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:2nd_draw_reverse}
  \begin{align}
    \p(B_{1} \|B_{2}) &= \tfrac{1}{3}
    & \p(R_{1} \| R_{2}) &= 0
    \\[\jot]
    \p(R_{1} \|B_{2}) &= \tfrac{2}{3}
    & \p(B_{1} \| R_{2}) &= 1 \;.
      \label{eq:2nd_draw__reverse_mixed}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
These conditional probabilities are intuitively correct, as can be checked
by simple enumeration of the possible cases in \fig~\ref{fig:worlds}. For
example, among all three worlds that have blue at the second draw, two of
them have red at the first; hence $\p(R_{1} \|B_{2}) = 2/3$. Also, if we
have red at the second draw, then logically red cannot have been drawn at
the first, otherwise there would not have been any red left; hence blue
must have been drawn at the first: $\p(B_{1} \| R_{2}) = 1$.

\medskip

The following two relations between the conditional
probabilities~\eqref{eq:2nd_draw_mixed} and
\eqref{eq:2nd_draw__reverse_mixed} are relevant to our discussion:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:compare_conditionals}
  \p(R_{2} \|B_{1}) \mathrel{\bm{\ne}} \p(R_{1} \|B_{2}) \qquad
    \p(B_{2} \| R_{1}) \mathrel{\bm{=}} \p(B_{1} \| R_{2}) \;.
\end{equation}
As we see, the probability-calculus does not prescribe the equality nor the
inequality between probabilities for events of similar kind but at
different times (which therefore are \emph{not} the same event). Any
relations of this kind will depend on the specific situation. You can
check, for example, that in a scheme of drawing with replacement for both
blue and red, we would obtain two equalities in place
of~\eqref{eq:compare_conditionals}. In a scheme of P\'olya draws for blue
(blue is returned plus an additional blue) and replacement draws for red,
instead, we would obtain two inequalities in place
of~\eqref{eq:compare_conditionals}.

Something analogous \citep[see][for an exact parallel
see]{portamana2003_r2004} happens in inferences about quantum measurements.
The conditional probability for the result of measurement $R$ made at time
$t_{2}$, given the result of measurement $B$ made at time $t_{1}$, is not
necessarily the same as that for measurement $R$ made at time $t_{1}$,
given measurement $B$ at time $t_{2}$. The time ordering of measurements is
extremely important in quantum theory (as it is in the urn example above).
In particular, if our goal is to actually \emph{retrodict} the result of
a previous measurement or state from the information gained in a subsequent
measurement, we must be very careful not to confuse the conditional
probabilities. The times of the two measurements cannot be swapped.

It should be noted that the conditional-probability
rule~\eqref{eq:conditional_prob} is in fact routinely used in quantum
theory in problems of state retrodiction and measurement reconstruction
\citep{jones1991b,slater1995b}[\chaps~7,8]{demuynck2002b}{zimanetal2004_r2006,darianoetal2004}[see][\sect~1
for many further references]{maanssonetal2006},
for example to infer the state of a quantum laser given its output through
different optical apparatus \citep{leonhardt1997}.
